    "translate": "The winter is really lovely, but not as much as the night. Fortunately, you are traveling through the frost and dew, with your carriage and horses braving the cold. Farming does not prosper in years when weeds overwhelm the grain. Not only are your guests dispersed, but birds and mice move their nests. I only see the heart of the pine, protecting tender vines from the frost. In my youth, I was treated lightly, so how can I keep the kindness in my heart? Recalling the old heroes, their words weighed heavily on the rivers and mountains. With the wind, they play their swords like a musical instrument, playing for you the songs of the swallow."

    "translate": "The western sky meets the sea at dusk, where the pearls of the bidragon glow and burn with the moonlight. The mariners are startled by the underwater fire, as precious treasures scatter along with the dragon's path. A fleeting desire is born in a single night, as the moonlike dragon body is scrutinized repeatedly. Diving beneath the waves, one forgets oneself; it seems that the vast ocean has no spiritual beings. The sea palace is in the midst of the dragon's slumber, and last night's solitary light is now played with. The river god worries about the poverty of his watery domain, while the celestial buffalo dares not stir. A crystal-clear ball of ice holds all around, as people enter the light within its boundaries. The sun's shadow trembles as it rises, and the bronze mirror shamefully hides its spirit for eternity. The old fisherman on the shore complains of the reckless child, crying over his lost pearls into the bottomless waters. What need is there for riches before the dragon's jaws, when countless jewels have been buried in the belly of a fish? The scales of creatures transform into yin and yang, filling the sea and breaking through the mountains without any beauty. He sighs, trying to regain his lost pearl desires, as this land leaves behind its agricultural and pastoral life. The old man drinks the wind and wears his clothes, casting away the prickly eggs of the wild chicken."

I carry the grace of the imperial palace in my heart, overseeing the justice at the edge of the bridge over the mountain. You are in the Dragon Horse headquarters, handling reports and messages. Although we are a hundred miles apart, our spirits and dreams meet each other. Our images are in our minds, and our letters convey our longing. Please love me deeply, and lightly load the oil for the carriage. The autumn air is cold at the gate, and the frost is just beginning to form. There is a lack of flat land here, with hills and hills interspersed. Who knew that the journey was not far, but the travelers were often tired. You can bravely face the strong wind and stay overnight on the dangerous incline. Your affection is deep and does not tire, as you dismount and open your eyebrows. We sit and contemplate each other, counting the passing years. Everything can be put aside for now, and we can enjoy a cup of wine together. The sun wanes suddenly, and the bright moon hangs high in the branches. Pulling back the curtains, I lead the jade to the front door, and extinguishing the candle, I face the frost on the steps. In the courtyard, there are sparse reeds, which are heard to be blown by the wind. The long river rolls up the color of the cloud, and the dense green is without flaws. A word opens my heart, and I am wide and desirous. As the night drags on, my cold thoughts are particularly suitable. There are no others in my eyes and eyebrows, and I leisurely solve riddles with you. Indulging in solitude, I ask you to recite more clear poetry. If you are satisfied, forget the words, let alone bamboo and silk threads. In a moment, three nights have passed, and I get up and sit up, feeling light in my limbs. Tomorrow I will leave, and it will be sad to say goodbye. When you leave, I will lock the door and walk alone in the empty hall. No one knows the loneliness within."

I drink wine before the wind, leaving monks to play chess in the bamboo. My companions laugh and ask, envious of my time for leisure."

After the rain, the distant mountains are refreshed, and the courtyards are filled with the first hints of autumn. My spiritual friends cherish cultivating herbs, while the elevated person laughs at raising fish. I am content to follow my nature, happily living a lazy and carefree life."

In this world, how can we face it? It's not easy to seek the dragon side. The smoke from the wet stove gathers on the oven, wild grass covers the roof.

I feel relieved by your company, as I am warmed by your warmth. We travel together for ten days, and our servants become more friendly. Upon arriving in the capital, there are numerous tasks, leaving little time for rest. I cherish your care, as it awakens me from my drowsiness. My thoughts and words repeat a thousand times, totaling 160. The high standards I hold cause my mind to be clear and cool, while the low mountains help me to become calm. I have heard that friendship is a gift, and only then can it be considered a favor. Gold and jade may fade away, but beautiful lines will always remain. I store them carefully, separated from common people. When I recite them on clear nights, it makes me feel like an mournful monkey."

    "poem": "秋蛩聲尚在，切切起蒼苔。\n久是忘情者，今還有事來。\n微霜風稍靜，圓月霧初開。\n此思誰能遣，應須執酒杯。",
    "translate": "The sound of autumn crickets is still there, cutting through the gray moss. I've long been an indifferent person, but now I have matters to attend to. The light frost and gentle wind have settled, and the full moon is beginning to shine through the mist. Who can send away this thought? One must hold a cup of wine."

    "translate": "In June last year, the cicadas should have arrived, and every time I heard them, my bones trembled with fear. Today, the honeysuckles are still in bloom, but I am worried that as I listen to them, they will become silent forever."

    "poem": "秋來吟更苦，半咽半隨風。\n禪客心應亂，愁人耳願聾。\n雨晴煙樹裏，日晚古城中。\n遠思應難盡，誰當與我同。",
    "translate": "As the autumn arrives, lamenting becomes even more bitter, half swallowed and half carried by the wind. The Zen monk's heart should be in chaos, while the sorrowful wish their ears to be deaf. Rain clears in the smoke-filled trees, and the day ends in an ancient city. Distant thoughts should be difficult to exhaust, who will share them with me?"

    "translate": "The feathers are not yet fully grown, and the bird is ugly compared to the rooster. Night after night, it escapes through the cage, perching on the stone for beating clothes."

    "poem": "春來深谷雪方消，鶯別寒林傍翠條。\n到處爲憐煙景好，隔簾多愛語聲嬌。\n不同蜀魄啼殘月，唯逐天雞囀詰朝。\n少婦聽時思舊曲，玉樓從此動雲韶。",
    "translate": "As spring arrives in the deep valley, the snow begins to melt, and orioles leave the cold forest near the green branches. Everywhere, we cherish the beautiful scenery of the smoke, and through the curtain, we love the charming sound of the voice. Different from the cry of the Shu spirit at the waning moon, only chasing the morning birdsong. When the young wife listens, she thinks of the old song, and the jade tower moves from this moment, stirring the clouds and joy."

    "translate": "Cast into a mirror free from dust, hanging before the emerald window like a jade stage. Embroidery ribbons seek together from the dragon's mouth, and the water lily flowers compete to open in the chest. Alone, the light is often seen with the phoenix's footprints, and the separation is caused by the magpie's shadow. It is suitable for Xie Nu to admire herself, and the moon goddess flies to the jade palace."

    "translate": "The people of the time dislike ancient paintings, leaning against the wall and not collecting them. Drops of dew break the glue mountain, and the wind blows through the silk sea in autumn. Remnants of the clouds fly inside the house, and a piece of water falls on the bedhead. It's still better than common flowers and birds; can you mend them, my lord?"
