Thin wine soon wakes up, the cold night passes, and the beautiful flowers are wasted away by the rain, hiding spring. She already regrets being a wanderer, and she knows nothing of seeing courtiers on the rivers and mountains. Whether their friendship is connected to wealth and poverty, there has never been much dust from cars at the simple door since ancient times."

The smoke and haze combine, and the sun and moon hang in the dark. Respectfully showing his willingness to accept guilt, Wei Ping also relies on power. I fear the danger of the nest and curtain, I do not wake up to the accumulated wood. I believe that if I can close my mouth, the villain will become even more numerous. Jinnian's slander is finally resolved, Lu's emaciation is difficult to cure. I just want to kill Huang Hao, I never knew the pioneer. I turn the ugly right and raise the tiger to seek completeness. Ten thousand chariots are in the smoke and dust, a thousand officials have swords and spears. The Big Dipper is splitting to the north, the earth axis leans west. Yuan Dong is not just so, Shi Zhao is not accidental. Central China becomes a fire of calamity, the East China Sea becomes a paddy field. Blood stains are ashamed of Ji Shao, who laughs at Chu Yan, who lags behind. The four barbarians follow suit, and one life is dared to sacrifice. The mountains and mountains are green and towering, the vast sky is old and bright. The sole emperor weeps, many people have forgotten the net.

She doesn't understand the emotions in her dreams of the palace, nor has she ever been jealous of the beauty of the Wu Palace. It's hard to teach her to appreciate wine, so she becomes listless in spring through longing and sadness. Under the sea of begonias by the swing, she whispers hurriedly, turning her head away from others as she adjusts her hair."

My arms are thin, my skin clear; my clothes are light, with a faint scent left behind. In the Southern Dynasty, the clothes are tight, and the hairstyles are high. The river is far away, the land is distant, and the clear waves flow gently. Ties of silk reveal tears; we each feel lonely."

    "translate": "Mianzhu is located in the east and west corner, a thousand peaks rising in succession. The steep and rugged mountains press down on the east, connecting with ancient Shu. Square peaks reveal their angles like exposed halberds, while sharp peaks are like arrow tips. Some peaks curve like crescent moons, while others gather like stooped pigeons. Their tails coils like snakes, and their necks lowly lie like rabbits. Some stretch horizontally like runners, while others rise vertically like bows. In the year of Zhenwu, the copper beams shake with the venom of centipedes. The Marquis of Jingzhao, with his nine lives, comes to govern as a shepherd. He leads his tiger and wolf servants, dedicatedly serving the standard. The government office is placed in a refined cottage, with windows facing the forest. It's the end of the heavy weight festival, and the weather is clear and solemn. The mountain is open from dusk to dawn, visible to all. The frost-filled sky is vast and desolate, with dense green mist floating. Coral emerges from the sea, and jade piles up to the heavens. Suddenly, the gloomy haze sets in, and the city receives a light rain. The summit has already frozen over, revealing the bright sun. Initially, it seems like a dragon carrying a candle descending from Kunlun. It also resembles the golden and silver terraces piled up on Mount Penglai. Purple haze occasionally shines beside it, like a quilt made of colorful fabric. The evening sunlight suddenly illuminates it, making the Red City seem broken and continuous. It also looks like boiling seaweed salt, cooked thousands of pots at once. Or like washing silk cloth in Chu, a thousand pieces unwound at once. Or like the crystal palace, where dragons and snakes intertwine in rivers and streams. Or like the stalactites in a thundering cave, opening up the rocks and valleys. The colors cannot be painted, and the creation provides enough. There should be robed figures, floating in the smoke. There should be five-colored birds, calling out with divine music. Although rooted in the Sword Gate, the caves must lead to the woods and houses. Separated by the sea, one fears being submerged. Among the jade orbs, there is no way to measure the past and future. How can I enjoy this place, spending the whole day gazing at the distance. Often, after writing documents, I sing and think about solitude. When the stars and arrows are swept away, the military drums welcome the chariots. Do not fly the thundering cart, nor tie the frogwood. Engrave your name on the Yanran Mountain, leaving a fragrance for thousands of years. Then you can enjoy your leisure, going alone with the herd of deer. Not caring about safety and danger, neither glory nor humiliation. But enjoying the fish in the moat, how can the crane in Zhongnanshan resent? Tie a belt of woven orchids, eat ginger to fill your stomach. Lie on the stone bed, letting the idle clouds touch you."

    "translate": "I have two acres of land, a hundred miles east of the Long River. The area is delineated by the surrounding dikes, with accumulated soil connected like a belt. The Songjiang River flows beside it, often carrying muddy water in spring and summer. If the dikes are not maintained in time, the floodwaters will never stop. I have been sick and sleeping for a long time, and my home is lacking in provisions. The fields are overgrown and abandoned, their farming tasks all neglected. Other crops have flourished like clouds, but mine is just ready for planting. Four boundaries are flooded, with reeds and rushes growing alongside. It's after the beginning of autumn, and the misty dew is heavy and gloomy. Although the work is completed, there isn't much left. How can the sea wind rise from the sky for days on end? As if trying to drive the vast ocean to irrigate this region. Oh, you wind master, there are many brave men in Wu. After nine years, they cherish every grain like life. In times of plenty, the price of grain is cheap, but in times of famine, it's expensive. People are weak and hungry, just waiting to exchange one for another. I am still ill and unable to work, spending two years in pursuit of my goals. I can't eat a single meal in peace in autumn or spare a moment in spring. My intestines churn with sadness, and my bones grow thin from damage. I don't want to see people, only ghosts. And I'm facing war again, constantly moving and fleeing. I used to hide in the western mountains, now I'm at the edge of the reed marshes. The abandoned fields are no longer sought after, those repaired still have use. I'll put on my official hat and cover myself with a blanket. I won't seek excess, or else I'll become arrogant and despicable. I hope to avoid begging, because begging is shameful. If pride and shame don't exist, they can be eliminated. I can achieve leisure, without hindering my study of history and literature. I'm about to turn forty, and my hopes are limited to this. There are still many difficulties in the world, and I must learn to farm again. Whether rich or poor is determined by fate, and misfortune or fortune is born from our experiences. If the wind doesn't starve me, the gusts should stop by themselves."

The precious bottle descends swiftly with the pulley, and the small child plays with the rope, hurting the clear ice.

Ji Lun angrily breaks the coral, and Ling Yun combs her hair and steps on the swaying fan. Among the sixteen leaves, the intruding light, the cold bell vibrates with the moon and mixed pendants. Unconsciously, the clouds and harmony dispels its remaining resentment, and the lotus peak whispers through the night with the koto. The quick rhythm writes the hurried hatred of Shang, and Qin's sorrow and Yue's tune quickly enough. Entering the fairy tower in a dream, the residual tunes are struck, and the frost flies, sharp and cold, onto the autumn jade."

The court of justice is quiet, with fewer public documents, and guests are invited to enjoy the mountains while wine is poured."

In the autumn, we set sail for the exam, and in the spring, we dance with the flags during the supervision of learning. As I approach the ancestral hall to ask questions, my smile opens like frost on my eyebrows. On my birthday, I greet the new year with a hundred bows. The golden and emerald vessels pass, and the dancing silk curtains are waved. The laurel branches flourish, and the mulberry tree's shade lags behind. You are chosen from all over the world for your talents, and you gallop a thousand miles a day. Compose the eight odes, reflect on the flat and distant, and shine in the clear ripples of the double stream. Come on, quicken your pace, and enjoy this extraordinary journey."

Alas, all I have now are books filling my shelves, which can provide solace for eternity. How can I dare to break the rules and compete with others in their pursuit of fame? I see those who do not appreciate the grandeur of Mount Tai, as they chase after deer instead. You drink from the Zen Mountain spring, and the cosmic cycle continues. You should feel the echoes of the crane's call and use your wisdom to polish your skills. It is indeed pleasant to move to a new home, but you must endure the cold winter and enter the valley. Where in the world does the universe begin and end? I will follow the path of the homing crane."

Although their dry remains can be offered to the temple, their true essence remains hidden. This year, the flowers bloom earlier than usual, causing me to tremble with fear. Early blooms may be beautiful, but their full bloom is still far away. The balance of yin and yang requires proper order, which cannot be easily explained to the common man.

Luxurious extravagance burns brightly, the original energy is being consumed. Do not let your thoughts wander too far, focus on the lessons of the common man. There is a subtle essence to learning, don't just listen at the walls. Eliminate obstacles in your source, open your heart with virtue and righteousness.

Pointing to the white clouds in the distance, we set off in high spirits to seek the peaceful nest. The ancient temple's golden and green hues are quiet, the dark crown and colorful emerald fading away. Strange rocks resemble sleeping bears, old trees coiled like dragons. The cool shade blends with the wild landscape, creating a refreshing breeze. At the cliff's jagged break, driftwood forms a flying bridge. The sun's rays prick our skin, causing small mosquitoes to boast. As the day grows long, my poetic thoughts thirst, the fragrant water from the mountain provides relief. My lighthearted madness astonishes the audience, my boundless spirit soars through the reddened sky. The moss on the rock obstructs my writing, I grasp at the tender branches for support. Our words and silence are left to each other, there is no need for light teasing."

I come to visit Peach Village, going all the way to where the path stops. The flying vines shake the spring mist, and the white snow sprays cleanly.

    "poem": "幾年麗澤道方亨，別駕重來路竟成。\n由是之焉知所止，安而行處坦然平。\n疾徐先後將觀禮，作屏經營豈爲名。\n萬里修程今放步，胸中堠子自分明。",
    "translate": "After several years of beautiful and prosperous paths, the journey once again becomes a well-established route. From this point on, one can know where to stop, and walk confidently and safely. At different speeds and in different orders, we will observe etiquette; creating screens is not for fame alone. Today, we embark on a long journey, and within our hearts, our inner timers are clearly defined."

    "translate": "Piling up books, I briefly glance through them; determined to go, I have no time to plan. Rain and wind on the observatory offer a breathtaking view; clouds and snowcapped waterfalls make for an inspiring journey. The twin stones of the Emperor are hard to find; the two goats of the south creek are no longer sought. My old inscriptions are gone, my name is shameful, relying on others' stay."

    "translate": "Xuanhe Mansion stands proudly in the east, with a clear view of the vast plains. The layered mountains have affection and are suitable for evening contemplation, while the two rivers reluctantly flow westward. Inviting the wind and moon to write elegant verses, driving away the clouds and smoke to awaken the pillars. Who is leaning on the railing to inspect, there are boats all day long at the ferry crossing."

    "translate": "Politically, a benign atmosphere reigns, bringing peace and harmony; \nThe scholars rejoice, and the people live in safety, with disputes cleared. \nIn the final days, conventions are often simple and crude; \nGreat men's endeavors must be grand and expansive. \nWith renewed dedication, we rebuild our homes and lands; \nWe honor the past, while forging new bonds with the mountains and streams. \nDo not merely seek pleasure in life's journey; \nIn poetry, we embrace the timelessness of ancient and modern emotions."

    "translate": "A cluster of towers and pavilions stand on the outskirts of the county, where the moon shines brightest. The mountains shake with jade-like colors as they rise in the southeast, while the water surges like golden waves flowing to the northwest. Old trees adorn the guest quarters, and the female walls are carefully arranged to protect the red columns. When will the west wind arrive to celebrate the vast fields of yellow clouds?"

    "translate": "The moon points to the mountains, quite uneven; why do we need a breeze on the river? Although the words are endless and extravagant, the meaning of equality has not yet been fully expressed. Yan Zi's five words can endure forever, and Yin Hou's thousand years have already formed an icy alliance. Would you like to manage the bright moon, there must be a breeze that is unique in this world."

    "translate": "The sky is the source of all life, and I delight in reading about the rain stars. I no longer doubt the abundance of the constellations, but what concerns you about the weak bottle? It's because I wholeheartedly dedicate myself to serving my country, and I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the people. If we can bring rain to end the drought after long anticipation, our actions will be as exhilarating as the strong wind at the Happy Pavilion"

    "translate": "The fragrant orchids and sweet osmanthus have faded, and the dry chrysanthemums lie scattered on the ground. We used to buy seeds, but there was no place to plant them; we cherish our love for these flowers, year after year. Most of all, we admire their austere character and graceful appearance. The small garden should be surprised that there is no beautiful verse yet, as the subtle fragrance has not reached the wine."

    "translate": "Nine people enjoy the clear view together, remembering the time when the moon is still not slanted. The poet's scroll is quiet this year, with last year's flowers still on the twisted branches. The immortal scholar has repeatedly wanted to compile a catalog, but he feels deeply ashamed that his phrasing is not masterful. He often relies on the solitary fragrances to embellish his work, and when he collects them, they shine brilliantly under his pen."

    "translate": "Teng Liu drives his car to knock on the gate at night, and the smoke disperses in all directions. The cold and elegant reflection of the book is found in the desolate alley, and the refined emotions carved into the words move the northern mountains. Standing guard, one thinks of the river, where the wind and flow do not reach the Baba Bridge. Soon, the moon rises, and the plum blossoms are cold; people and plum blossoms leisurely face each other."

The auspicious harvest is still far away, and the concerned scholar is just beginning to worry. Fortunately, there are no other alarms in the north, and the eastern ruler has already begun to help. A guest is just bringing his poetry, and the talent is truly a sign of good luck"

    "translate": "Switching the pliers and hammer for the Red City, the first sound knows it's boiling. When the opportunity arises, the drumbeat and shouts must be precise, and the protective magic power should not be entirely relied on. The bottom of the foot sprouts a clear spring, and the spine and pillar stand tall together. Indeed, the oar rushes through the vast ocean, and the corner is originally lacking a light."

It's hard to predict what will happen in the next three years, and the gains and losses will eventually become dust. It's funny that recent enthusiasts are so blindly pursuing glory, only to fall into disgrace"

    "translate": "Year after year, I brush the lonely tent with my traveling sleeves, enduring the wind and frost as if I have gained some merit. Once again, I plan for a thousand miles of travel, and my feelings of parting are deeply embedded in numerous couplets. The reed banks waver with new whiteness, and the maple rivers fall with cold redness. If I happen to hear the wild goose's call, I will frequently send words, and when the cold window faces the clear breeze, I long to be with you."

Strange rocks fiercely devouring the cold rapids, the small sail breaking through the evening smoke. Relying on his clear laughter for a thousand times, or otherwise singing loudly for three or four cups. Send a message to the fugitive immortal poet friends, help him prepare some branches of plum flowers in advance."

    "translate": "Low-hung paper screens block out dust, cold through the solitary quilt dreams easily return. The night mist has not yet dispersed, the sand banks are dark, and the river is just approaching its course. Searching carefully for scenic spots to create poetry, chasing all away sorrow into wine. Most of all, repeatedly pushing open the tent flap to inquire, there is no plum branch beside the shore."

The red flowers attract new butterflies, while the green moss grows on ancient vines. Inspired by the poetry in the study, my heart momentarily ignites with excitement, only to turn back to ashes once more."

The dragon-shaped ridge rises majestically, and the stream reveals a faintly cold silver wave. My poetic thoughts caress the steep monk's tower; my resolute heart remains unshaken, even as I leisurely perch on the defensive wall. Zhong Xian lies atop a hundred feet, perhaps not finding such peace in his time."

In a narrow life, meals are more delicious; In dangerous times, avoiding heights is wise. I can't stand my solitary awakening; Envy you embracing all things happily."

Poetry cannot be satisfied without wealth, wine forgets hatred and is not forbidden. I sit before an ice statue with nothing to say, and a lonely lamp and remnants of fire accompany my clear chanting."
