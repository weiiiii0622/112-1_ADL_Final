    "translate": "My home has a scissor, they say it's iron from the ghost kingdom. Cutting silk and brocade is never dull, used for three years and then bent. Southern craftsmen use steel, making it coiled and ready to cut at will. Transforming it into two knives, the color welcomes the snow and the blade is sharp as frost. Both blades are as thin as autumn ice, the edge sharpened by the crescent moon and the scabbard inlaid with gold. The battleaxes and daggers of the Yue and Wu are not worthy of praise, cutting through ivory and jade should be proud. Trying it out on the Han River daily, the cold sound echoes in your hand. Shock and fear fade away, leaving only a slight smoke on the blade. Oh, how bright and dazzling the knife is, the demons must hide and be afraid. If not for the skilled craftsman who changed its form, it would only be used for sewing and stored away."

In the past, I returned with extra resources, but now I leave with only food. A single arrow is tucked into my summer clothes, and my bow will not be drawn again. I say to the brave men, the joys and sorrows of life must be borne by oneself."

We meet once every ten days, nine days spent on the road. What wealth and honor can this husband be? Willows can be broken, but Mount South cannot be moved. A woman's value is in her marriage, there is no provision for remarriage. When marrying off your daughter, don't expect too much; her heart desires what is suitable. It is better to be with a lowly spouse than to be separated from a noble one. The blue leaves are dense, and the blue flowers are like pomegranate color. The young wife returns to the young husband, their radiance harmonizes naturally. Who says that we are married to serve our hundred years together? There is loyalty as a husband, and disloyalty returns to others. Love is like a cold fireplace, discarded like a autumn fan. Mountains and rivers rise before us, yet we do not see each other. Men are not children, why force familiarity? Do not see the morning fungus, easily formed and easily faded. Travelers want to go on the road, those staying at home also go out. The north wind blows across the river bridge, the four corners of the world are filled with melancholy clouds. Is it not that they yearn for our home, and the husband is grateful for his gratitude? In the future, there is sunlight and moonlight, achievements in the source of the river. The young wife stands before the horse, please listen to my words. When spring comes, the grass grows, who can be without separation feelings? Earnestly unfold your heart, seeing new things but not forgetting the old. Looking far at Mengmen Mountain, I humbly report to the gentleman. As a wild goose following the sun, do not learn the west flowing water. I have heard of birth separations, but there is nothing more sad than this. Together in the same vessel, yet separated by a thousand miles below the hall. Being friends with you in poverty and humility is like floating on water on duckweed. Leaning on angels, we are born and die together."

The Han pipes and drums echo through empty waters, while the Wei lands and rivers bask in half-setting sun. A thousand years have passed, yet their deeds still seem too fast; a single day of sorrow seems like an eternity to bear. As the wind and smoke rise together, they long for home; even in the absence of spring, their distant gaze still hurts."

Our laughter and conversation are trivial; our encounters are often vague. The three mountains are out of sight, and a hundred years pass swiftly. Past events bring sorrow, and new acquaintances bring no joy. My beloved leaves again, leaving me more alone. Although Huian and Tao Qian seek solace, they find it in different ways. The host's kindness is deep, while I am unworthy of it. In twists and turns, I am supported; in adherence, I become weak. My border memoirs remain unfinished, and my recruitment poem remains unwritten. The noble have their morning meal, ignoring their promises for the night.

The imperial residence is in the mystical Penglai, where the solemn bells and water clocks keep time. The general leads the feather-like guards, holding spears and patrolling the palace walls. The emerald canopy is set up, with snowy weapons and soldiers arrayed in the heavens. The court lamps glow brightly in the distance, with sun and moon emblems on the banners. The holy emperor wears a dragon robe, and the palace doors open to welcome him. The Dragon Tower is shrouded in purple smoke, with princesses walking through the heavens. Six ethnic groups are arranged in their respective positions, wearing different clothing. They raise their heads to look at the jade plaques, not knowing the names of the palaces. The feathers on either side are opened, and the dance fills the courtyard. The court attire is adorned with jade and gold, making a shimmering sound. The Grand Harmony is prepared with elegant music, as the phoenix and the crane sing together. The auspicious clouds wander, with the bamboo and stone instruments making a cold, clear sound. The three ministers offer their respects, and the supreme ruler is granted eternal justice. Daylight shines upon the four directions, as the queens protect peace and prosperity."

Waterfalls cascade in front of the temple doors, making our clothes feel the chill of autumn. Moss-covered stones have purple flowers, and stream leaves are cut into green oil. The base of the pine tree supports the high pavilion, allowing the magical mountains to float. In the county, distinguished doctors visited this place one month ago. They celebrated the rain gods and had no time for further stays. Twenty couplets of new poetry were sent to those who seek the mountains.

Is it not a waste of time, not working hard from an early age? From today on, let go of your thoughts, strive for good plans. As long as you succeed, I don't care about your needs. I should accept this discipline, be ashamed of laziness. I will return at the end of the year, do not long for travel."

    "poem": "上陽宮到蓬萊殿，行宮巖巖遙相見。\n向前天子行幸多，馬蹄車轍山川遍。\n當時州縣每年修，皆留內人看玉案。\n禁兵奪得明堂後，長閉桃源與綺繡。\n開元歌舞古草頭，梁州樂人世嫌舊。\n官家乏人作宮戶，不泥宮牆斫宮樹。\n兩邊仗屋半崩摧，夜火入林燒殿柱。\n休封中岳六十年，行宮不見人眼穿。",
    "translate": "From the Shangyang Palace to the Penglai Hall, the imperial retreats are far apart. The former emperor visited many places, leaving traces of horses and carriages across the mountains and rivers. At that time, the counties repaired them annually, leaving the inner court ladies to admire the jade tables. After the forbidden soldiers seized the hall, it was permanently closed off from the peach blossom garden and silk embroidery. The songs and dances of the Kaiyuan era were found in ancient grass, and the Liangzhou music was disliked by people. There was a lack of people in the palace, so they didn't plow the walls or cut the trees. The two sides of the battlements were half collapsed, and the night fire burned the pillars into the forest. Let the Zhongyue Mountain be sealed for sixty years, and the imperial retreats will no longer be seen by people."

    "poem": "長安惡少出名字，樓下劫商樓上醉。\n天明下直明光宮，散入五陵松柏中。\n百回殺人身合死，赦書尚有收城功。\n九衢一日消息定，鄉吏籍中重改姓。\n出來依舊屬羽林，立在殿前射飛禽。",
    "translate": "The wicked young man of Chang'an is famous, robbing merchants below and drinking upstairs. At daybreak, he goes to the Bright Light Palace, dispersing among the pines and cypresses of the Five Graves. A hundred times he has killed, deserving to die, but there are merits for capturing the city in the amnesty edict. One day, the news settles in the busy streets, and the village clerk changes his surname in the registry. He returns to join the hawk army, standing before the hall to shoot birds in flight."

    "poem": "自去射虎得虎歸，官差射虎得虎遲。\n獨行以死當虎命，兩人因疑終不定。\n朝朝暮暮空手回，山下綠苗成道徑。\n遠立不敢污箭鏃，聞死還來分虎肉。\n惜留猛虎着深山，射殺恐畏終身閑。",
    "translate": "After shooting the tiger and bringing it home, the official shot the tiger late. Facing death alone as the tiger's fate, the two people are still uncertain due to suspicion. Day after day, empty-handed, back to the green shoots on the mountain path. Standing far away, not daring to pollute the arrowhead, hearing the death and coming to share the tiger meat. Rescuing the fierce tiger for a deep mountain, killing it for fear of being idle for life."

    "translate": "I will return far away, better than when we parted. At home, our reunion is warm, and there's no shortage of joy in the new return. I wish the wheels would move slowly, but I think of the swiftness of the horse's hooves. Just let us be poor and face each other in our home, rather than surrounded by gold in the vast ocean."

    "poem": "人間百戲皆可學，尋橦不比諸餘樂。\n重梳短髻下金鈿，紅帽青巾各一邊。\n身輕足捷勝男子，繞竿四面爭先緣。\n習多依附攲竿滑，上下蹁躚皆著襪。\n翻身垂頸欲落地，却住把腰初似歇。\n大竿百夫擎不起，褭褭半在青雲裏。\n纖腰女兒不動容，戴行直舞一曲終。\n回頭但覺人眼見，矜難恐畏天無風。\n險中更險何曾失，山鼠懸頭猿挂膝。\n小垂一手當舞盤，斜慘雙蛾看落日。\n斯須改變曲解新，貴欲歡他平地人。\n散時滿面生顏色，行步依前無氣力。",
    "translate": "All kinds of human entertainment can be learned, seeking the tightrope is no different from other joys. Re-combing short hair and wearing golden ornaments, red hats and blue headdresses on each side. Light and agile, better than men, competing for the lead around the pole. Often practicing to attach to the slippery pole, going up and down gracefully in socks. Turning over and hanging from the neck, about to touch the ground, but stopping to lean on the waist like a rest. A large pole that a hundred men cannot lift, half of it coiled in the green clouds. The slender girl remains calm, dancing a dance to the end. Turning back, she feels that people are watching, afraid that the sky has no wind. Risking further risks, she never loses, like a squirrel hanging from the head and an ape hanging from the knee. Dangling one hand during the dance, looking at the setting sun with slanted eyebrows. Suddenly changing the tune and learning new moves, eager to please others on flat ground. When dispersed, their faces full of color, but their steps were as weak as before."
