The bitter tune evokes the resentment of the people of Jing, while the distant echoes of the emperor's spirit are felt. If the remnants of her music can be appreciated, please enjoy it for yourself."

For nine translations, the barbarian kings send their emissaries; for a thousand years, we serve as loyal subjects to the holy emperor.

The solitary city opens its mirage tower, and the morning sun shines upon the red wheel. In early times, one recognizes the coming year, and the Turquoise Mountains share equal parts of jade and silk."

The river at Jiande has already receded; the Xin'an River branches off once again. Looking back at Yanzi Sho, I clearly recite Xie An's poems. After the rain, the mountains are a vibrant green; in the setting sun, the gibbons sing. The land of Wu is unreachable; I brush my hair, thinking of you."

Dreaming of butterflies on clean mats, hanging ermine drapes in crimson silk. The mountains do not hide the doors, the sun shines through as tea is poured. The elegant appearance returns to Anstone, deeply understanding Ansha. A poem of praise for Ji Gong, reciprocated with jade flowers."

The four horses have no time to rest, where are the three sacred mountains? The giant turtle cannot be caught, and the high waves are so towering. The morning sun shines on a hundred valleys, and the vast expanse connects to the nine realms. We embrace the flowing water and incorporate the vastness, adding to the delay in observing the differences. As the sun rises, we see fish eyes; as the moon is full, we know the eggs of the clam. Our footsteps do not reach far, but our hearts guess with spirit. The distant colors are connected to the lonely island, and the empty sounds contain the booming thunder. The wind carries the tribute from Yu Chang, and the water stops the disaster of Tian Wu. I grasp the reins, ready to strike the falcon, and the oblivious gulls return. Following my feelings, I compose elegant verses, leaving behind dust and dirt. The official way is finally used differently, and I still have the honor to accompany the literary division. I long to thank my friends and colleagues, and I am ashamed that I am not a dragon chariot."

Riding my bicycle, I entered the regions of Yan and Zhao, feeling independent and at ease. Little did I know that between wars and horses, I would suddenly embrace my life again. I cherish clear discussions and high spirits, ignoring the setting sun's decline. I write poems on the stone tablets of the guesthouse and drink wine on King Yan's stage. Looking north, the desert stretches before me, with snow covering the sky. Along the border, there are no strategies, and gazing at history is empty and futile. I admire Yue Yi, but his conquest of Qi aroused suspicion. Jing Ke's going to Qin and not returning saddens me. So many promises lead to death, and public loyalty becomes a source of misfortune. Parting from you, I fear the fleeting years will soon pass. How can we both grow old and forget our bodies? My brothers are like Lu Xun and Pingyao; their fame is connected to the eight generals. In the year of the Biji star, the traitorous officials waited for the disaster. The barbarians rode into Longshan, and the imperial carriage passed through Ma Wei. The thousands of officials had nowhere to rely, and the millions of common people were only sad. The punishment of Lu Li moved the gods and goddesses, and the earth and heaven opened when Liu Yan was safe. I ran through the dust and wind, quickly encountering thunder and rain. I held the banner and went out from the Huai River, calling for the talents of the Chu state. I vowed to cut down the whales and exhaust my donkeys. The petty people were unkind, slandering me to the point of death. Fortunately, the sun and moon shine brightly, illuminating everything. I stayed in the Luoyang palace, and the official offices were filled with weeds. At that time, I cleared the atmosphere and had not yet eliminated the ringleaders. I set up a long encirclement behind the river, but the general also had problems. The retreating army was like a blaze, and the scattered soldiers fought each other. In one night, the Yan and Luo rivers were empty, and the living creatures were exposed. The nobles hid in the grass, and I wanted to run to Jiang Huai. I stopped at Wan Ye and Xiang Dong, and the city walls and houses were desolate. There were thorns and brambles everywhere, and only piles of bricks and tiles were visible. The travelers had no color, and the bones of the dead were covered with green moss. I removed the Peng Men guard and was able to enter the imperial hall. I was excited to look up at the phoenixes and herons, and I was glad to contribute salt and vinegar. I drove the message to the distant frontier, my worries accumulated and difficult to dispel. I left the people's disputes and taxes like mountains and cliffs. I thought about the capital, once with Lu Mi. Since I became a civil servant, the stars shine on the street. How can I visit the remote areas and return to my precious gems? Gold and jade are expensive, and flutes are easy to harmonize. I recite loudly in the clear autumn, and the cool breeze blows under the locust tree. Unwittingly, the bandits and rebels claim their names and reputations. I bitterly sighed over Chen Hou's eulogy and lamented Ji Kang's cup. We parted ways in the bright sun, and the young days are gone. I lie down and read Zhongsan's essays, remembering Tai Chang's study. I sing in praise of you, but also sing to myself."

It is not difficult to walk, and it is a rare treasure in the era. Holding it every day, missing it is like a neighbor. There is a boat in the sea and river, and a hat in the hills. What do you intend to do, and I know where to go. Each person suits different situations, and the old values true human nature. Don't make cloud and mist plans, and hurry to follow the noblemen."

Straight up to the cloud cluster, perching on emptiness and embracing the natural melody of heaven. Soaring above the vast western sea, standing alone beyond the flying birds. Only then do I realize that joy is at an end, and it is just right to enjoy the heart. The connected mountains are shrouded in the Wu Gate, and towering trees swallow up the Chu Pass. Cities and walls fill the windows below, and the world's images return to their places within our palms. Distant thoughts stay with the river sail, and the evening hour gathers the spring mist. The luxurious carriage seems to move stupidly, and creation provides for the vast mass. Why wait until there is no body before knowing when to retreat?"

The majesty of the law subdues the desert, loyalty and righteousness move heaven and earth. The old general grows pale, the scholar dares not to speak. Relief from encirclement relies on divine calculation, stopping the killing for the sake of the emperor's kindness. Only the rivers and mountains are vast, the empty tree stumps stand in the distance."

The great achievements of the Great Wall are recorded, and the mansions of the capital are complete. After the horizontal flute plays the plum, there will be a spring scene song.

I can't get rid of a few white hairs, and I don't hesitate to drink a hundred punishments from the deep cup. The holy dynasty also knows the ugliness of the low-ranking officials, and one thing is borne by the mercy of the Emperor of Heaven. After drinking, I have no place to return, and I stand alone in the vastness, reciting poetry."

Entering the glassy expanse in a boat, we experience different events and extreme joy and sorrow. We no longer know the crocodile's actions or the whale's devouring; the bad wind and white waves are beyond our expectations. The owner unties his sails, and the boatman is delighted without any dust. Ducks and geese scatter, and oars and pipes create a green emptiness. Fishing poles and vines are deep and unknowable; lotus leaves and flowers are calm and clean. In the clear current of the Bohai Sea, we descend to the infinite Southern Songnan Black Mountain. South of the half pond, the mountains are completely submerged, their shadows dancing gently between fusion and dissolution. The boat strikes against the clouds at dusk, and the moon emerges from the Blue Tile Pass. At this time, the luminous pearls are also released by the prisms, and the spirits of the dragons gather to beat drums. The Xiang Fei and Han girls dance and sing, their golden and emerald flags shining faintly. I worry about the approaching thunder and rain, not understanding the intentions of the gods. When will youth be defeated by old age? The past joy and sadness are so many."

I'm ashamed of living life like Yan and Zheng, admiring Zhang and Bing's attachment to worldly things. The world values fast horses, I'm content with mud-crawling creatures. Knowing when to return is important, not pursuing pleasures together. With retirement, one doesn't need an official position, growing older brings peace and quiet.

The cloud gates are empty and floating, and the wind pines are solemn and chilly. The stone gates are covered with frost and dew, and the jade halls are filled with moss and moss.

Travelers help each other, but the river is too wide to cross. My old wife is in a different county, and our ten mouths are separated by wind and snow. Who can endure not to care for a long time, and maybe we will share hunger and thirst together. When I enter the door, I hear wailing, and my young son has died of hunger. I would rather leave one sorrow, and the alley is also sobbing. I am ashamed to be a father, and I can't feed him to death. How can I know that autumn has not arrived, and the poor has a dead person. He is often exempt from rent and taxes, and his name is not listed for military service. I still feel bitter, and ordinary people are necessarily restless.

Fire clouds appear at all times, lightning flashes constantly in sight. The rain pours heavily on the lonely peaks, floodwaters rush and collide. The mists blend with the yellow river air, all streams converge in the empty curves. Early morning, I gaze at the high waves, suddenly fearing the dark cliffs may collapse. I fear the mud might entrap dragons and deer gather on the heights. Dead branches pull up trees, boulders fill the space. The sound of wind and ghosts descends, the rapid passage of time is witnessed. Without the flow of a thousand ravines, how can the four great rivers be respected? When I see the rising spring, I fear the sea and river may overflow. Sand washes away the banks, pine and cypress are stripped from the ravines. Rivers break through mountain gates, the earth axis cracks as it turns. The rivers of the Great Bend and the Yellow River arrive at the Pass of the Gods; they have not stayed there for a night. Several states will sink, as if listening to the cries of ten thousand households. Mud and dirt still remain, the raging winds and waves store their anger. When will the boats and carriages be connected, so that the gloomy atmosphere will no longer dampen things? My floating life is turbulent, my path is restricted. It is difficult to find a place in human society, the stone walls slip by my feet. The clouds and thunder continue, the dangerous paths are even more constrained. Throughout the heavens, there is no bridge or railing, wishing for the water to shrink so I can cross. I mourn the forest hermits, who have not escaped the belly of the fish. I raise my head to the blue sky, longing to ride the majestic swan."

The imperial carriage stops at Phoenix Mountain, where the valley serves as a vital pass. To the west, we control the weak waterway; to the south, we defend the Fohian corner. In this peaceful land, robbery is shameful for its officials. Especially since the barbarians have not been defeated, we must control the vast expanses. Inside the government, Wei the magistrate demonstrates his gentle ways. His talented nephew possesses great virtue, making them both worthy of admiration. Accepting your orders, you ride to the Headwaters of the Tao River. The ancient sands crack, and the accumulated dark clouds are dense. The Qiang people wear leather boots and fur coats. Blowing a horn into the moonlit cave, the green mountains display their banners. Startled birds flee from dead trees, and the dragon rages from the old well. Since ancient times, this place has been uninhabited, now fought over by spears and shields. Alas, the literati and scholars are angered and rush into the woods. In the center of the land, battles rage, making future meetings uncertain. One's destiny is determined by centuries, who could have known of their rise and fall? Hold on to your good friends and walk together through life. Discussing strategy in the distant ravine is clean, allowing for free exploration. Your poetry is beautiful, and your calligraphy is often shared."

    "translate": "Emperor for two years, the eighth month of the Leap Year is auspicious. Du Zi is about to embark on a northern expedition, asking about his family in the vastness. At this time, he encounters difficulties and struggles, with little leisure time in the court and countryside. He regrets that his private favors have been bestowed, and the imperial decree allows him to return to his humble abode. Bowing and departing, he fears and trembles for a long time, not daring to leave. Although he lacks the appearance of an adviser, he fears that the emperor may have forgotten something. The emperor is a restorer of the middle kingdom, and his plans are closely woven. The eastern Hu are rebellious, and I am angry at their actions. Tears flow as I bid farewell to my journey, the road still hazy. The world contains wounds and scars, when will the anxiety and sorrow end? Slowly crossing fields and roads, the people are sparse and desolate. Most of those I encounter are injured, moaning and bleeding. Looking back at Fengxiang County, the flags and banners fade into the evening. I ascend the cold mountain again and again, finding places to water my horse. Entering the suburbs of Bin, the rivers and streams surge. A fierce tiger stands before me, howling and splitting the gray cliff. The flowers of this autumn hang down, and ancient wheel ruts are worn into the stones. The blue clouds stir my high spirits, and secluded matters can bring joy. Wild fruits grow among the oak and chestnut trees, some red like vermilion, some black like lacquer. Wet by rain and dew, they bear sweet and bitter fruits together. I think of the Peach Garden within, and I lament my clumsy existence. I gaze at Fouzhi, where the hills and valleys emerge and disappear. I have reached the riverbank, while my servant remains at the tree's end. Hawks cry in the yellow mulberry trees, and wild mice dig up their nests. I pass through battlefields at night, and the cold moon lights up the white bones. The million-strong army at Tongguan dispersed, leaving no trace. Half of the Qin people were destroyed, becoming alien creatures. I have fallen into the dust of the north, returning with all my hair gray. It has been a year since I returned to my thatched cottage, and my wife and children wear clothes patched together. My sobbing echoes through the pines, and the bitter spring water gurgles with sadness. The son I doted on in life had skin as white as snow. When I saw him, he turned his back and cried, his dirty feet unworn socks. In front of my bed stand my two young daughters, their skirts just below their knees. Their old father's heart is sick, lying in bed for several days. There is no silk in his bag to save you from the cold. Makeup and cosmetics are unwrapped, the quilt slightly arranged. Your thin wife's face shines, and your silly daughter combs her hair herself. They do everything their mother teaches them, quickly applying makeup as they please. They move around, applying red lead and mud, their eyebrows wide and messy. They live with children again, as if forgetting hunger and thirst. They ask questions, pulling their beards, who can scold them? I think of the trouble I had with the bandits, willing to endure the noise and confusion. Returning home, I comfort myself, not being able to say anything about physical needs. The emperor is still in the dust, practicing military exercises for a few days. Looking up at the changing sky, I feel the evil air clearing. The north wind blows, dark and desolate. The king of the Hu wants to help, and their custom is good at charging. He sends 5,000 soldiers and 10,000 horses. These people are honored, and their bravery is respected by the four quarters. What they use is as swift as eagles, breaking enemies and shooting arrows more quickly than ever. The emperor's heart is somewhat anxious, and public opinion is eager to seize it. The conquest of the Lo River and its tributaries is within reach, and the capture of the western capital is not difficult. The imperial army asks for a deep penetration, and their sharp edge is ready to launch. This action opens up the east and west of the Qing River, and we can soon look north to the Haihe River. The accumulated frost and dew of the heavens represent the stern and just punishment of nature. Calamity turns to destruction in the year of the wolf, and the momentum of capturing the Hu is formed in the moon. The life of the Hu will not last long, and the imperial net cannot be cut. Remembering the beginning of chaos, things were quite different from the ancients. The traitor was cut into minced meat, and the evil was swept away with him. I do not hear of the decline of Summer and Autumn, and the empress dowager was killed by herself. The Zhou and Han dynasties were revived, and Xuan Guang was indeed wise. General Chen is upright, wielding his sword and displaying his loyalty and valor. If there were no people like you, the country would still be alive. The grand hall of the Great Unity is desolate, and the white animals in the imperial gate are lonely. The people of the capital hope for the jade screen, and the favorable atmosphere flows towards the golden gate. The imperial mausoleums have divine spirits, and they are cleaned and swept without missing any. The great achievement of Emperor Taizong is brilliant, established and extensive."

The dust of the Hu people surpasses the Taihang Mountains, and various tribes arrive at the capital. The Hua Men must be kept, and the original fields turn desolate."

The opportunity for a good encounter was thwarted, and I faced the vast emptiness with sadness. As the woods grew dark, the deep bells stopped, and all night I remained hidden in the stone tower. Wang Qiao descended from the heavenly altar, with the faint moonlight reflecting on the white cranes. In the morning, the clear stream flowed swiftly, and the path home seemed like an old journey. I would not shun the calluses on my shoes, but I longed for the golden medicine. Heading east to my former retreat, I still remembered the joy of companionship. Leaving behind Master Dong, he now stands alone and desolate. Why am I a traveler in the borderlands, where my spiritual aspirations have long waned? Whom do my wife and children belong to? They bear the responsibility of their previous promises, even though they are saddened by their hair turning gray. I support myself with a staff and gaze at the clear autumn, feeling inspired to enter the Lu and Hu regions."

Stepped clouds and steep cliffs form a tall ladder, with solid stone steps holding it together. Through a thousand ravines, sparse forests lean at crooked angles, their accumulated shadows following the surging waves. The cold sun shines faintly outside, while the strong wind howls through the air. We stop to rest our saddles on the ground, realizing the height we have climbed. Passing through various terrains, both humans and horses are exhausted. Our fleeting lives have a predestined course, and hunger and satiation cannot be escaped. I sigh to my wife and children, why do I follow you all?"

Winding up the steps, one enters the spacious and serene courtyard where a sleeping tiger awaits. Here, Wen Kong found a place to dwell. Gazing down upon the bustling city below, smoke and dust swirl around the steps. My master has spent over a decade outside, spreading flowers and seeds. The elder generously distributes gold, while the Zen altar remains peaceful. The great pearl sheds its impurities, like the bright moon shining in the sky. I, a man from the south and north, have long been tainted by poetry and wine. How can I deserve to wear such fine garments? Kings and nobles share the same fate as ants, all eventually perishing with the passage of time. I yearn to learn the ultimate truth, returning to my original state of mind. Like a golden comb removing an eye membrane, this understanding is priceless. There is no birth, only continuous growth and development. With these principles in mind, we can navigate life's journey together."

I fear keeping it could bring misfortune, and using it would be like mixing it with thorns. The clothing determines our status, and it has been so since ancient times. Now, as an inferior old man, I have no interest in fine clothes. The magnificent treasures of the palace would bring me misfortune. I lament the state of the world, with its endless battles and violence. Those in power enjoy luxury, while others suffer. Li Ding died in Qi Yang, and Lei Yang was granted permission to commit suicide. They were both proud and wealthy. It is said that they had many gold coins, but they eventually faced regret and loss. How can a simple farmer like me accept such kindness? The magnificent cloth rolls back up for the guest, and I feel at peace. I shake off the dust from my rough mat, embarrassed by the guest's humble meal."

It cuts through the earth's axis, with steep walls gathered around it. The autumn wind and fog sweep through the landscape, shrouding the sun and moon. From this point on, the gorges are the narrowest, allowing only floating debris. Yu's achievements support the creation, with the waterways dug unevenly. The ancient channels of the vast waterways form a huge snake. The wind and smoke from the Wu and Shu regions are vague, and the boats travel through the salt and hemp fields. As a wandering traveler, I am now mixed with the dirt and sand. Everything depends on its original nature, and my body is not willing to be extravagant. A thatched roof covers a bed, and a clear pond has remaining flowers. Muddy wine and rough rice are before my eyes, without complaining. There are few people in the deserted mountains, and the remote areas have beautiful sunsets. Poverty and disease are natural, and wealth and prosperity follow life. I have lived through wars, and fortunately, my home is covered by a thatched hut. Stones rise into the clouds, and the pines extend their moonlight. Enjoying beauty goes beyond itself, and reason is satisfactory without boasting. I have lived to an old age, and dare to live a high-minded life. Writing this reveals my past, and looking back is like evening red clouds."

I come here to escape the heat, asking my children what they have been up to. Inside the weaving basket, they cannot enter or leave. They pass through gaps, leaving behind dirty cushions. I forgive the ants and sparrows, but not the foxes and hares. All should grow and learn, becoming equal opponents. I will maintain the cage and fence, observing damage and repair. I understand instructions clearly, and I will analyze everything. In the morning rain, I reduce my worries. These birds flow like water, and their hearts are not like stones. I rely on them in the cold evening, removing ice and trouble. I am not like an old man in a cemetery, trapped on the roads."

Alas, the long-lasting wars have left the fields shrouded in thorns and brambles. It is known that the bitter kale competes with the sweet basil roots.

Some people are as stable as Mount Tai, while others cut off their right side in the north of Jibei. The north wind begins to breathe again, and the first emperor's career is revealed. The two imperial princes cry in the west, and the nine temples rise from the ruins. The soldiers of Heyang have not dispersed, and the traitors are still loyal to Sima. They come from the Ji Stone again, burning the world like a hunt. High-five laughs at Lu Shan, and you make another great contribution. The king of the strange land records his achievements, and small enemies are afraid. With troops guarding the river and the Bian River, a thousand miles feels comfortable. The gnat flies busily, and the autumn rain falls on a leaf. Looking inward, I have not entered the court, and my tears finally fill my eyes. The large house loses its high pillars, and the Great Wall is cleared of its remnants. I have used my white feather fan for my whole life, and it has fallen into the dragon's chest. Elegant expectations and youthful charm meet in Wei Li. The three armies lose their luster, and the heroes suffer heavily. The straight pen is in the historical records, and the future will clean the chest. I think of crying alone in my grave, and the south barrier stops my boat. Supporting the upside-down forever, we never succeed in crossing the river. Who is the tired {Cao Er} in the end? He weeps in the Bashu Gorge."

He has read and memorized hundreds of books, and his writings leave audiences in awe. He has experienced various responsibilities, and he is always passionate about combating evil. The Han discussions are still orderly, but the barbarian horses suddenly charge. News flies from the rivers and mountains, and people ask about the nobles.

In the past, during the Kaiyuan period, the emperor's grace was frequently shown. Entering and leaving alone were not at regular times, and the etiquette was different from that shown to the ministers. He loved his diligence and cleanliness extremely, which exceeded the bond between relatives. Calmly listening to government affairs in the morning or in the stormy weather, he suddenly thought of taming fierce animals, with the park filled with clean dust. The silk flag moves as one, and ten thousand horses are respectful and brisk. The king is summoned to shoot ducks, and he bows and takes a stand. The arrow flies within the horse's saddle, and the upper part returns to the green dragon. The purple boundary feathers flutter, and the moon wheel is wiped down. Although the barbarians gain much, Heaven laughs without being new. The king shoots at an object every time, and his hands are tied with gold and silver. A protest letter about hunting is in his sleeve, and he has been urging it for a long time. There is no fear of a broken hook, and the holy ears are full of benevolence. The official is exempt from providing supplies, and the water has algae and scales. Not only the emperor is old, but also the king is loyal and diligent. In his later years, he devoted himself to making wine, and he invited white guests to extend his door. The path is wide and accommodates those who cannot, and forever misses serving the fragrant carpet. He loves learning and upholds loyalty and righteousness, and his virtue must be soaked with his hat. Writing and weaving beautifully, the articles seem to have a divine presence. The river is wide and cannot be traced, and the graves are old and there are foxes and rabbits next to them. The Han Central District is there, where culture and elegance can see the natural ties. How can you open my sorrow and sail a boat on the distant rivers? The warmth of the past flavor, youth has already written the silk ribbon.

Remembering Li Gong, he had roots and foundations in the literary world. His voice and writings were strong, with rich and clear creations. His style spread like metal and stone, chasing and carving the sharpness of mountains and mountains. He understood the nature and creation, and his learning integrated heaven and man. Petitions went to his door, and inscriptions were published worldwide. Fulfilling deep expectations, they arose in common examples. The white poplar road is desolate, and the precious pearl is revealed. The dragon palace tower rises, and the flood of clouds guards the great calamity. The affairs of Confucianism and ancestral officials, past servants' thoughts, are all empty. Looking back on the past, not just to encourage future generations. Coral hooks and Qilin woven cloth follow the sword table, and righteousness is obtained without any false years. During the partition and removal of the steeds, my gratitude and concern have not yet been settled. Everyone returns to the beauty of support and abandonment of many hidden dirt. Walking alone for forty years, hearing the cry of the wild goose in the nine chambers. Alas, the charm of Jiangxia, covering the robe of Yan Ni. In the past, during the Wu Hou era, many favored and beloved people were employed. The good and bad opinions of the Taoist Master were refuted by two Zhangs. The decadent customs were chilled by the birth of the wind, clearing away the autumn sky. Loyal and faithful people carry their hatred and resentment in the deep courtyards and palaces. Exiled early, tired of the hot weather. At dusk, the owl enters, and the emperor of the Cangwu is broken. The prosperity and decline of the world are too fast, and the star carriage has no safe stop. Several bamboo poles of the Han Dynasty, I once supported Lord Wen [Hui]. I finally mourned the Luoyang prison, near the small official's corruption. The evil step was initially slandered, and it was easy to be deceived. Once upon a time, in the Linzi Pavilion, we drank wine and entrusted our friendship. We revisited the Eastern Capital, and the morning shadows changed the porch. Discussing literature with Cui and Su, the water flows and disappears. I humble myself to the hero of Yinchuan, not willing to accept the beauty of the special advance. Whether it's Zhang Xuanguo's criticism or the crisis of being held, it's not easy. The fame of the ancients is not so simple, and the key is quick and open. Even my family poetry, I sweep away the fog and mist from my heart. With enthusiasm, I continue the work of the real person, and I admire the jade mountain and the Osmanthus. The bell law is hanging high, and the kunming fish spews. The blood of Qingzhou flows, and the tomb of Wenyang is buried. Sad eulogies are desolate, and the graceful waves extend. My descendants exist like threads, and my old guests' ships are stuck.

I am transferred out, the imperial wind blowing through the yellow roof. I have no time to accompany the eight horses, sent to the enemy's land in sorrow. In my life, I have filled my cup with wine, ending friendships along the way. In the autumn of illness and anger, my hatred turns the stone. The Emperor restored the nation, distinguishing between obedience and rebellion. Fan Ye looks at his son, Li Si remembers the yellow dog. Secrets hidden in the pines, the vast ocean's origins and endings are shallow. The bright emerald sword, sharp enough to slice the rhinoceros, is not used only against enemies. Instead, it is used by later generations inappropriately, causing me to suffer in silence. The brilliant mushrooms in the study grow, a testament to the past, awaiting those to come. I do not hang gold, nor do I throw it to the warrior eagles. I have been friends for thirty years, who else can I roam with? Meng Yang is gone, the net of sin has caught him. On your day of death, O child, happiness was short-lived. The price of rice in Chang'an is high, and all the survivors have perished. When will the wars end?

He is lonely, thinking of the earth steps, but he has no time to wait for the equality of Shi Jing and Ying Zi. The emperor is in the white jade hall, relying on you in the golden palace hall. The age of the Rock of the Great Seal is marked by the day when heaven and earth become like a frog and a mosquito. Retiring to eat and recite in the great court, I do not care about the weeds and branches. My bones are afraid of the past sages, and my black hair has changed in human society.

The yin pipes send forth yang energy, and the virtuous air is contained in the public tripod. Only then do I understand the noble heart, which uses talent and literature as a boundary. The green snake rises, and the witch's hut stands side by side. Luxuriantly entwined with dark rays, the letter memorializes and competes with each other. Since it is our family rule, there is no lack of warnings from single characters. A thousand years pass in the southern sea, and the name is connected to the image of the red bird. Returning to my old forest home, I yearn for the imperial palace and gently extend my neck. The waves and tides are written by the historical pen, and the great Yu Mountains are barren.

Day and night, they eat grain, living in a makeshift shelter by the city's eastern gate, collecting herbs in the northern valley. With a heart unbending between frost and snow, not dependent on green vines. This is not intentional solitude, but follows nature.

    "translate": "In ancient times, there was a beautiful lady named Gongsun. With a dance and her sword, she moved the world. The audience watched in awe, as the earth and heaven swayed. Her movements were like the sun setting, and her graceful posture like the emperors riding dragons. She appeared like a thunderstorm subsiding, and then like the sea and the rivers reflecting the light. The red lips and pearl sleeves were silent, with her disciples passing on her beauty. In Linying, the beautiful lady danced brilliantly, answering my questions and touching my heart. The former emperor's 8,000 attendants, including Gongsun, were the best. In 50 years, the wind and dust shook the royal court. The musicians and dancers dispersed like smoke, their remnants shining in the cold sunlight. The golden grains of rice in the south have long been harvested, and the grass in the Qutang stone city is withered. The music and dancing on the ornate banquet came to an end, as the joy turned to sorrow and the moon rose in the east. I do not know where I am going, my feet are aching in the desolate mountains."

    "translate": "In the western capital, when the barbarians came, they filled the red palace. At midnight, they burned the nine temples, making the Milky Way red. The tiles were lifted off and flew for ten miles, and the curtains were scattered empty. With a sick heart, we cherish the wooden statues, one by one, as the ashes are carried by the wind. Together, the dark night arranged the iron horses, and the clear dawn dispersed the brocade silk. The traitorous minister's rebellion was celebrated as a success. At that time, the concubines were killed and became waste piles. The emperor was trapped on the jade throne, with the white lines peeling off the painted insects. I do not know the whereabouts of the two saints, and the old man secretly cries. When the chariots returned, the pillars and beams suddenly became taller. The old people cried again, and the temple officials planted elm trees. It is no longer grand and magnificent, but it has already shown the strength of the emperor. Last spring, we offered sacrifices to the ancestral temple, and the emperor attended the ceremony personally. As a close adviser, I am honored to follow the other ministers. I ascended the steps and held the jade book, and the golden bell was bright. I served the temple and felt ashamed to be near the front, and I was near the washing dragon in the palace. The emperor is a filial grandson, and the five clouds rise from the nine layers. The mirrors are replaced with powder and cosmetics, and the green feathers are still green. Previously, we were tired of the Uighur and later suffered from the Rong. We offer pork and sheep meat, and the arrow screens walk with bows. How can we go from the western extremity to the east? Dedicate your body to the city gate, and the officials and common people block the gates. The master will understand the reverse and forward, and the origin will return to the beginning and end. One day, the emperor will blame himself, and the wagons and books will be passed for thousands of miles. The arrows and bullets are used as plowshares, and the soldiers are allowed to follow their duties. The redundant officials resume their occupations, and the locals return to work as farmers. The emperor and his ministers maintain frugality, and the court and the people cheer together. The revival is like the early years of the country, and the successor is like Emperor Taizong. The emperor listens to advice, and the gentle wind and sunshine blend. The cherry branches on the red pavement are hidden behind the silver wire cage. A thousand springs recommend the tomb, and it will last forever. The capital is no longer on fire, and the rivers of Qingwei are opening. The original pines and cypresses are called back, and we grow old and suffer from wandering."

    "translate": "In my youth of 14 or 15, I roamed the literary world. Cultured scholars like Cui and Wei, they regarded me as a worthy companion. At age seven, I longed to be strong; at nine, I sang the praises of the phoenix. By age nine, I had written large characters, filling a bag with my work. With a bold nature and a passion for wine, I hated evil and held firm convictions. In my youth, I associated with old friends, drinking deeply and seeing all eight directions. I descended to the Suzhou platform, ready for a voyage at sea. To this day, I have regrets that I couldn't reach the end of the East. The legacy of Wang and Xie is distant, the tombs of the Hou Lu are desolate. The stone walls of the sword pool are narrow, the lotus fragrance fills the Changzhou marshes. The majestic Changmen Gate rises to the north, with the clear ponds reflecting its grandeur. I often went to pay homage to Wu Taibo, tears flowing as I contemplated the past. Recalling Duke Jiaogen's defeat of the Wu, I longed for the glory of Qin Shi Huang. I smelled the dagger as I ate steamed fish, laughing at the trivial affairs of the world. The fair ladies of the land were as pale as the moon, the Jian Lake cool in May. The Xianxi River harbors hidden beauties, making it impossible to forget. Setting sail for the Heavenly Maiden Mountain, I returned to my hometown in middle age. I breathed in the air around Qu Ju and Cao Liu, my eyes averted from their lowly positions. I left the capital, wandering between Qi and Zhao, my horse and robe elegant and free. I sang and hunted in spring and winter, calling hawks in the cypress woods and pursuing beasts among the clouds and snow. I shot down a falcon once, drawing my bow and arrow to fall a crane. Su Hou was delighted to ride, as if carrying a strong staff. For eight or nine years, I returned to Xianyang in the west. I would associate with the best wordsmiths, enjoying the company of noblemen. I dressed myself in fine linen and entered the hall of light, the emperor summoning me for an audience. I had no love for worldly things, but I drank deeply, trusting in my actions. My black fox fur coat became worn, my gray hair still fitting the cup. In Du Qu, the elderly gathered, the four suburbs filled with white willows. I was respected by my neighbors, feeling the urgency of life and death. The rich indulged in their pleasures, while the common people suffered. The northern frontier rose like a mountain, the imperial journey lasting a long time. The two palaces were on alert, the empire a thousand miles away. The air over Kongtong was dark with murderous intent, the banners of the Lesser Sea yellow. The achievements of Emperor Shun were passed on to his son, and he personally led his troops to Zhuolu. The imperial regalia surrounded the heroes, the tigers and wolves devouring each other. If one of the vassals didn't fulfill their duties, the barbarian soldiers would become more aggressive. The army marched hastily, the sick and wounded filling their ranks. I secretly filled the gaps in the government, my heart full of anger and frustration. I felt sorrow for the burned temples and the suffering people. I wept as I remembered the past, my tears flowing until morning. As a small official, I had no voice, living in exile with my old illness. I yearned to be free, but my feathers were weighed down. The autumn wind stirred the mournful valley, the delicate fragrances of the green banians abandoned. When I avoided praise and followed the fisherman, I washed my hands in the surging waves. My accomplishments were a match for my peers, but as I aged, I faced the cold frost of the year. I saw the talents of Chi P'i, a man who exceeded expectations. The villains were still rebellious, waiting for the emergence of heroes."

Within the city, there are nine thousand households, with tall buildings shining brightly along the main roads. Boats and carriages travel across the land, and guests and hosts share joy and amusement. In the dust of battle, swords are wielded against the unjust, as gold is spent recklessly. Lives are taken in the chaos, and retribution is swiftly sought. I recall sharing drinks with Gao and Li, discussing our friendships at the wine shop. They were both passionate and talented, and their words enriched my life. We ascended the blowing tower in intoxication, gazing at the plains from a historical perspective. The clouds of Mengtang drifted away, and the wild geese called to each other in vain. The former emperor was keen on warfare, and the world had not yet withered. Brave generals conquered the West, breaking through the forests and lands of the barbarians. Millions attacked a single city, displaying their victory without hesitation. Armies were discarded like mud, and every inch of land was fought over by a hundred men. The expansion of the borders continued, and the Great Harmonious Rule departed. All my friends in turmoil and separation have passed away, and the years have fleetingly gone by. Where will my declining years be placed? Alive or dead, I am once again lamented. In solitude, I feel even more shame, alone in this corner of the world. The noble steeds have left, and ordinary horses are but mere creatures. I no longer see Yan and Bao, and I tie my boat to the riverbank in Jingwu. As I eat, I fear I may neglect the orphaned."

The regions of Youyi and Jing have been pacified, but the frontier still requires bow and arrow. This person has escaped, is he not returning eastward on the path of my life? The universe is vast, yet our bags are empty as we adapt to our surroundings. The strong laugh at the weak, young people deceive the elderly. Between host and guest, it has always been cramped and crowded. You now depart from Jingyang, sailing alone like a migratory bird. In the two states, heroes and outlaws gather, and people and horses are all brave. Please accept hunger and cold once, and accept nourishment and education again."

Talent is exhausted, harming the body, and suffering from thirst and official positions. Old friends remain as before, speaking of danger and stumbles in times of crisis. I am willing to grow old with illness, and you carry the burden of caring for the world. Why are you struggling for food and clothing, your color is slightly satisfied? Go on a long and hard journey, following everyone's wishes. Boats have no roots, crocodiles and turtles are good at creating mischief. With many water bandits, especially caution against the wind and breeze. In the tumultuous times of war horses, often killing long-serving officials. You must advise the eastern vassals, preventing them from being reckless. The country takes the people as its foundation, fish hunger for fragrant bait. Please pity the deep wounds, report to the Emperor's envoy. Choose carefully the ambassadors, know the trials of virtue. Compassion and punishment, it should be different for the wise and the foolish. The heroes hate petty gains, outstanding people want to achieve themselves. I present you with \"The Tiger,\" which comes with a sour nose."

Traveling within the four seas, I rely on my children to provide for me. Encountering new young people, I rarely see old friends and relatives. With a lowered face and humbled demeanor, I allow my old friends to guide me. The younger generation is full of vigor, their actions reveal my age and ugliness. Constant setbacks have crushed my former aspirations, as if I were a man struck by a stroke. I have been away from the west of Sichuan for a year, and now I face the South Dipper. On a solitary boat amidst the spring flowers, I rely on willows and reeds to support my aging teeth. The mysterious burial site of the Nine Mysterious Mountains, even the saints' bones decay. The Taoists of the Tang Dynasty have wasted their time, beating and whipping the sun and moon for a long time. Among them, the like-minded Li Bai and Cao Zhi, their slander and destruction led to their own downfall. The dense Qingxiang stones and the reverse movement through the forests create an atmosphere like a drunken cup of wine. Singing and singing each other, we accept and teach each other. Knowing how to touch on various topics, each one relies on their talents to succeed. Since ancient times, economic talent has been rare, what has happened to it? The evening grayness, the bear hanging from the cosmic kraken roars. The yellow bear is at the top of the tree, guarding the group of tigers. My frail body where will it go? Enduring dangers, my face becomes even more thickened. Perhaps I will discuss this with the wise, silently integrating my flaws."

Birds and birds suffer from fat autumn millet and peas, and dragons and dragons want to stay in the cold sand and water. When will the war drums and horns stop in the world, and the troops will die all day in front of the array? Write a letter to Pei and show Su, feeling ashamed that I need someone to support my life. Dedicate Emperor Yao and Shun to you all, and think about donating your life as soon as possible."

Recently, I have implemented positive policies, all of which have been well-received by the public. In difficult times, it is important to maintain safety and security, and I dare not take on unnecessary tasks. I continue to strive for success, always seeking new challenges and opportunities. I enjoy discussing and solving problems, and I am skilled at handling various tasks. My books are full of advice and guidance, and I am constantly running around in the palace. I have yet to fully exhibit my abilities, and who would be my partner in power? I ask my loved ones about their well-being, and I cherish the elderly and weak. I am like an old man wandering the south, or a beggar lost in the north. I have become a poor fish in a dry rut, or a lost dog without a home.

My enthusiasm stirs the people of Jing and Heng, and I look back on my life, searching for my true companions."

    "translate": "Admonitory officials are not unaccomplished, the meaning of poetry is well-known. The origin of breaking through is a matter of course, who dares to compete as the vanguard? Thoughts drift beyond the clouds, the laws surprise the gods and ghosts. There is no regret left, waves alone mature. The wild people find their place, and the will of heaven is thin on transient life. With chronic diseases, I rest in Confucian clothing; I believe in the banner of the guest. Building a residence in the ethereal, traveling and eating through the years. The envoy seeks Yan He, everyone is tired of Yiheng. Expecting a promise to be heavy, suddenly making my heart lean. You see the crying at the end of the road, you should worry about the infantryman Ran."

Marquis knows what kind of nobles they are, and their writings truly contribute to their lives. They strive to surpass others, easily falling into obscurity. Leaving behind Panshui fishing, they hold on to the fine tools of Yingzhou. The sky is now approaching, and who else will be close to the imperial robe? The chicks of the phoenix cave are all good, and the dragons of Longmen are new. Righteous voices are stirred up, and defeats are naturally avoided. What direction do you want to go when the journey is long and the sky is high? Learning poetry is still like a child, and I miss the best guests in my hometown. I can't be the same as Zhao Kuo, and I sigh for Xie Shen after him. My plans are doubtful, and I miss the pines and bamboos of the past. Present your gifts to the emperor, and pay a visit to the Purple Throne in the middle. Follow the gathering of various heroes, and your talents will be displayed triumphantly. You have suffered from previous politics, and your schemes are unique. Your life is affected by jealousy and cruelty, and everything becomes more bitter. You are in the painting and ink ground, and your favor is poured down like rain and dew. There are scholars who are worried about starvation and will report to Pingjin at any time."

Seeking perfection in etiquette, loyal to the point of forgetting sleep and rise. The sovereign's affection is constant, retreating from court as if without support. Divine nectar flows like ants, rare feathers or eagles may be bestowed. Clear passages free of dust, the imperial messenger travels daily. Leisurely enjoyment in the evening, a life of filial piety and righteousness praised. Embracing their relatives, who dares to ask about the royal tomb? Academically rich with Confucian knowledge, words adorned by skilled craftsmen. Pens fly like phoenixes, chapters end with birds taking flight. Brilliant logic in conversation, friends forget each other's forms. A long-lasting bond can be tightened, a promise not to be proud. Already honored as a poet, what need is there to face Li Ying? Grace and favor are repeatedly bestowed, respect and weight are overwhelming. Gazing at the night through the fog, the crisp autumn air clears. Wine is served on the banks of the river, ducks and geese roost with lights shining. Flowers, moonlight, and revelry fill the night, escaping the heat of summer. Cold water from the gold-lined well, the roof moves with the ice of the jade urn. Drinking only from the three paths, living in the hundred layers of the rocks. Using a measuring jar to explore the sea, sipping wine as if from a cup. The treasure remains hidden, perhaps the divine ladder can be ascended. There is a guest at the gates of King Huai, unashamed of being compared to Sun Deng."
