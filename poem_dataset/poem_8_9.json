Touching the past seems to be sparse and desolate, but understanding it is extremely refined. He remains firm in danger and his opinions are unbiased. He regrets that his achievements are not yet prominent, and his valuable advice has not been fully disseminated. The person expects greatness, but it is difficult to match their aspirations. The world is united, and the emperor relies on cultivation. Unfortunately, the principles are empty, and good deeds are just empty talk. Seeking education or consulting sages, asking the source of things returns to heaven. From a government position in Wu County to six feathers abandoned by the riverbank, it began as a day of silk and turned into a year of withdrawing from the zither. The golden ointment was not completed, and the jade pendant was left behind forever. Fate and fate are mysterious, and life and death surprise each other. How can a man who has forgotten his feelings love the net all along? Because of deep compassion, true nature is moved. He mourns under the empty forest and weeps in the autumn scenery. The Master has few brothers and sisters, and he comforts the orphan with sadness. The clouds pour down, forming a gloomy knot, and the cranes are joined together. Letting go of his thoughts, he orders his carriage to leave, and bids farewell to emptiness at the banquet. The peach trees shade begins to merge, and the guest seats are always hanging. When you suddenly leave, you look forward to returning to the capital. Realizing the joy of the banquet is separated, sorrow is prolonged by the years. Grass turns into a signet, and footprints move the green money. If you can meet in the afterlife, you will have no karma. I wish you would show your business and dedicate yourself to it. Missing you becomes lonely, and you go alone to the Western Springs. Wanting to see an old friend's heart, you occasionally read their contributions. Sincerely admire Tao Jingjie, now value Chu Xianxian. The traces of their footsteps will leave love, which can be passed down for eternity."

As soon as the zither and singing begin, all other sounds cease; hold the strings and do not stop the golden cup. As the pleasing sounds end, the elegant sounds arrive; fish gape and cranes wander, the host's high emotions begin to open. High emotions are free from usual constraints, and sometimes have no trace in famous ways. Achievements were first attained in the general examination, and articles have already topped the list of others. Often laughing at Stone Cong's unreasonable feelings, lightly pursuing beauty leads to disaster. You have beautiful women as your companions, who do not stop learning and growing. Loving your natural desire for little, you are content with your humble income. Sent away on an assignment, you have no anger like the ancients; friendship is forgotten, following the path before. Unexpectedly, your entire family has come from thousands of miles away, and once again, green springs appear in the lake. The Wuxing mansion is secluded and leisurely, allowing you to hide there. Sometimes, your reputation is discussed alongside Xie Tafu; watch as you carry prostitutes like the east mountain."

We maintain our fasting and meditation in the Long Happiness Palace, and preach the way in the Great Bright Palace. This place is hard to reach, and the affairs of the various heavens are different. After the flowers scattered at the Buddhist sermon, the empty realm is filled with fragrant wind."

The thirsty Quaifa dies on the long journey, as if seeing the king's name inscribed in the center. Clearly, the night moves from west to east, and since ancient times, there has been a path that leads to success again. The old leaves of the sun block it, shining brilliantly and reaching for the sky. Travelers sweat and turn into rain, their mouths parched and their throats dry from dust. The western suburbs are shrouded in mist during the day, leaving little hope for the suffering people. What strange trees and monsters hide dragons, shrinking their scales and tails to be lazy. If they don't send the waters to the world, where will the wind and thunder go? The dried-up crops on the original land turn into flames, and the mountain spirits' prayers are powerless. Luxurious homes call for a gentle breeze outside their curtains, with water patterns clearly visible on the mats. In the painted hall, jade fans create an autumn night, and beautiful songs surround the beams, urging Mochou to hurry. The sun bird falls asleep after drinking all its wine, and is helped up to the moon-viewing tower in the west garden. The scorched dead in the abandoned fields are not our responsibility, as there is gold in the treasury and grain in the granary."

He shows me three hundred poems on ten scrolls, with golden and green ink burning brightly on Sichuan paper. The bold and elegant spirit is impossible to measure, leaving me stumbling and mad. The vast outskirts stretch endlessly, with the bright green fading and the remaining smoke collected. Our open minds face endless scenery, as the setting sun casts its light on the jagged peaks. In awe of the huge ship's high sail, the waves split and surge like flying immortals. Turning back, I catch a glimpse of five thousand feet, with the fragrant incense and waterfall springs falling. Why do the ancients boast of eight measures, daring to determine beauty and ugliness today? The wind drives the thunder, temporarily ceasing, as we claim our place among the masters. Swiftly as eagles and hawks soar, hunting through the clouds and across multiple levels of the sky. Foxes cower and dare not move, as the twin birds call beneath the swift wind. Sadness like the Xiang Spirit crying on the Xiang River, with sobs and wails separating through the mist. The deep green of the Nine Mysterious Mountains rises majestically, as the ethereal bones grow cold and disappear. Cleansed like wild guests tapping on Yue bowls, with clear and ringing sounds encompassing the cool autumn. The cocky chicks call uncertainly, their cries frozen into the night, still lingering in the tower. High as the space between the heavens and the earth, where the white sparks and green patterns are indistinguishable. The immortal cranes fly leisurely through the clean green, while the giant sea serpent emerges from the sea with the Penglai islet on its head. The former poets sing only in the Hanlin Academy, with divine old styles that are so profound. Creating life with your pen, shining brilliantly without bitter and bitter inscriptions. Dreaming of the bright moon, you float down to the Heavenly Fae Peak. Emptying lakes and seas into hundreds of characters, each one immortal and resounding like a golden bell. Today, you have companions who can match your talents, with pearls and gems piled high in the mysterious garden. Riding side by side, you explore Kunlun, attending banquets at the Queen Mother's Twelve Bowers."

Creation's heart is strange, and its nature is rich in essence. The jade trees are lush and lively, and the natural music has a melancholy sound. Quietly searching for the nipple, cautiously walking on the stone bridge. The spring water rinses the mother of the clouds, and the grass winds through the fragrant vine.

The road relies on the horse; day and night are entrusted to the rooster. Deep caves are inhabited by monkeys; pines are home to cranes. In summer, clear rock caves are enjoyed; in spring, water flows through the stone steps. Prosperous years coincide with a peaceful nation; heaven's way nurtures the people."

To the left and to the right, there are tiger and wolf tracks. Ten pieces and five pieces, different flowers are scattered about. Occasionally meeting each other, not yet deeply acquainted. Knowing if they are ancient people or present-day people, if they are Tanyan or Tanyi? I heard this sutra has profound meaning, and it seems that the emperor praises it for its subtlety. Closing my eyes and meditating, I listen carefully, as nectar drips into my burning intestines. The meaning of Buddha and the marrow of ancestors, my heart and the meaning of the scripture. Alas, it is just a matter of tapping your fingers or raising your hand, and you do not understand what is happening now. Great indeed! How extraordinary. The emptiness king wants all living beings to have, shining in 18,000 lands. Every land turns yellow and golden, and all four births and six paths shine in one light.

I just realized that riding a donkey is not the end, and I didn't go out of the door back then. I don't want the red dust to touch my footsteps. Today, I hear this sutra recited personally. I just realize that every step is a treasure, and I loved reciting and composing poems back then. I thought that searching blindly was confusing and distracting, and today I hear this sutra recited. It doesn't matter if you use pens and ink to support your true nature, and I played with children back then. I thought that time was half wasted, and today I hear this sutra recited. I just realized that gathering sand is not a small matter, and I once visited mountains and waters. I thought that another mountain was not my hometown, and today I hear this sutra recited. I just realized that there is no inch of land in mountains and rivers, and my monkey mind was not tamed. I used to think that locking up empty was meaningless, and today I hear this sutra recited. I just realized that there is nothing to be confined like fists, and the teacher recites this sutra word by word. Each word is chewed like nectar, and the taste of nectar is precious and delicious. Not on the lips, not on the teeth, but in the life-long heart. The teacher recites this sutra sentence by sentence, and every sentence is a white ox moving quickly like the wind. Not in the west or east, but in daily life, which we don't know how bitter it is. Like wine entering the intestines, rice entering the abdomen, the elder calls out loudly without turning back. It's like being deaf or blind, and people's ears aren't particularly sharp, their ears are especially deafened by the scriptures. People's eyes are not particularly bright, their eyes are especially blinded by the scriptures. Combining hearing and not hearing, combining clarity and confusion. Pulleys up and down, and vainly die. Although people may recognize the teacher's voice, who can understand the teacher's heart? Although people may recognize the teacher's appearance, who can identify the name of the teacher? The teacher's name is King of Medicine and Buddha's order, coming to treat people's mental diseases. Can make those who are confused awake, those who are crazy calm, those who are dirty clean, those who are evil righteous, those who are ordinary holy. If so, it will not only be respected by heaven, but also by dragons, ghosts, and buddhas. How can those who turn their backs on consciousness and mix with dust bow their heads and pay their lives?"

    "translate": "The holy monarch has obtained wise ministers, and the land is at peace. Respectfully considering the essence of the mountains, it mostly comes from the bright age. The lord holds the literary mirror, standing alone outside the dust. The king demonstrates worldly manners and ceremonies, and Cui Ling has a slight breeze. Fragrant orchids and snow embrace each other, and the steep and elegant peaks of Mount Tai are high. Ji Song leads the cold winter, and Zhuang's sword does not rust. The aura of jade frost is straight, and the master stone's gold hammer is large. The poem passes through the moon-like pearls, and the Taoist beat the Anqi back. The revival of the phoenix gathering, the straight path of the wind and clouds meeting. Ten thousand volumes seem to have no books, and the three mountains seem to pass through the blocks. Virtue is what heaven allows, who can be clean and clear to face? There is a law in the government, there is no dust on the hat and robe. Everyone looks forward to secrecy, and adjusts the ding and nai during the day and night. For the emperor to arrange the honorific, for the emperor to subdue the border. How can they know my intentions, worrying about this most in Pyongyang. He personally gave the red bow, and the people are dependent on it. When the enemy disperses next to the carriage, it is as if it is in the ice pot. Gong Yu loves integrity and fairness, and the second gentleman is too complicated. The pants and quilts are moving on the ground, and the parents are singing in the market. Snow locks the weapons, smoke surrounds the flag. Do you think of Zi Cheng's ice, or admire Ren Tang's onion? Suddenly like spring again, not just heaven's heavy burden. Proud and open as the sea ridge crane, cold and green as the fairy court cypress. Everything moves with harmony, every family has a new attitude. The lotus opens the tent screen, and the silk quilt is without any dust. The drum and gong pass through the frozen clouds, and the graceful waves move the ploughshare. Evil returns to refine its spirit, and the book of etiquette teaches the silk ribbon belt. Certainly in Yao and Shun's day, it will be like Fang and Du's generation. A wild man has a few lines, and his temperament is also generous. If he doesn't enter the hill gate, who else in the world will love him?"

With a worn harness for six horses, they do not fall from their destiny. The bustling sounds of life mix with the gentle wind. The dance holds a dry feather, and the garden harvests its offerings. The leaves are now golden, and the branches are now bronze. Leaf by leaf, branch by branch, all craftsmen are harmoniously managed. Reigning like Yao, without doubt or hesitation."

Occasionally, I wear a straw cape and hat to serve the empty king; with my remaining strength, what kind of literature should I create? My youthful heart is high in the blue sky, where knowledgeable friends are like dragons and phoenixes everywhere. Suddenly, I encounter difficult days, hiding in the mountains and valleys, sighing emptily. Sometimes, I accidentally break out of the encirclement and meet outstanding people, staying at my river tower for years. I lean in the jade tent, smelling the fragrance filling my clothes, and dreaming through the golden basin, raining and snowing. The east wind sings gently, and the deep cloud hermit calls me to return. I leave the grand mansion, not knowing what to do; the misty flowers and rain make the orioles fly, and the willows along the shore are intertwined."

Yongle's elegance is subtle, Liu Kan's politics are exceptional. In order to be clean, one must encounter nobles; in hiding, one is invited by others. At the Zen temple on the pine valley, incense is placed on the stone bridge. The wind and thunder patrol the fields, fish and birds sing together. In private matters, one must always be vigilant; for the people, one's concern is also evident. The path is high, no one can reach it; the favor is great, it is difficult to consume. The great enemy is difficult to overcome, the isolated city is often burned. The war flames rise daily, and care for the people is burning. Bravery and righteousness break through a thousand formations, punishment is planned for one day. The oath is against the sun and moon, the banner passes through the cold current. Ancient post houses are filled with river clouds, desolate palaces are covered with ocean rain. The sacred pines become thinner, the heavenly horses lose their fat. One seems to be guarding Chen and Wei, eventually becoming a part of Song and Yao. One has seen the clouds like deer, and the heads have been reported as captured. Returning the clear mirror, one longs for this again. One should pity the millions of households, praying for Tang Yao."

    "translate": "Windows and balconies embrace the cool breeze, forgetting worldly affairs. We love to talk about our ancestors, once staying in the vast wilderness. The sound of waterfalls fills our beds, and clouds drift past our incense burner. Send a message to the one who writes on the door, that we are studying in the monastery above."

    "poem": "淮海兵荒日，分飛直至今。\n知擔諸子出，却入四明深。\n衣必編仙草，僧應共栗林。\n秋風溪上路，應得一相尋。",
    "translate": "On the desolate battlefield of Huaihai, we are separated and flying apart to this day. I know you are carrying your children out, but entering the depths of the Four Mysteries. You must wear woven celestial grass clothing, and monks should share the nut forest together. In the autumn wind on the river road, you should be able to find each other."

    "poem": "三千功未了，大道本無程。\n好共禪師好，牆將藥犬行。\n石門紅蘚剝，柘塢白雲生。\n莫認無名是，無名已是名。",
    "translate": "After three thousand tasks remain unfinished, the great path has no fixed journey. It's good to be with the Zen master and follow the dog that takes medicine. The stone gate is covered with red moss, and the bamboo grove is filled with white clouds. Don't mistake anonymity for anonymity, because anonymity is already a name."

    "poem": "偷兒成大寇，處處起煙塵。\n黃葉滿空宅，青山見俗人。\n妖星芒刺越，鬼哭勢連秦。\n惆悵還惆悵，茫茫江海濱。",
    "translate": "The thief has become a great bandit, smoke and dust rise everywhere. The yellow leaves fill the empty mansion, and the green mountains reveal ordinary people. The sinister stars gleam beyond the border, and the ghostly wails spread across Qin. Sadness upon sadness, boundless and vast at the sea and river's edge."

    "poem": "滿眼盡瘡痍，相逢相對悲。\n亂階猶未已，一柱若爲支。\n堰茗蒸紅棗，看花似好時。\n不知今日後，吾道竟何之。",
    "translate": "Throughout my eyes, devastation lies; we meet, and each other we grieve. The chaos still continues, a single pillar to support it all. We steam red dates with tea, enjoying the flowers as if in their prime. I wonder where our path will lead us after today."

    "translate": "Silver ground has residual light, The righteous path benefits from its fragrance. Who can tell how much effort is expended in cultivation, With the frost on top of the bald head. The wind through the pines is dry after examination, And the tea in the eaves drops its aroma into the valley. Eventually, we must join the western society, And this county resembles Chu Cis Sang."

    "poem": "獨居三島上，花竹映柴關。\n道廣羣仙惜，名成萬事閑。\n病多唯縱酒，靜極不思山。\n唯有逍遙子，時時自往還。",
    "translate": "Living alone on the three islands, flowers and bamboos reflect the cottage gate. The path is wide, the immortals cherish it; fame is achieved, all things are at leisure. Illnesses abound, only wine is indulged in; tranquility reaches its peak, mountains are no longer missed. Only the carefree child, constantly comes and goes."

    "translate": "Gazing at the green, I think of my friend; In the courtyard, orioles warble a hundred times. Only by staying in one place can I avoid longing for you. Clouds and water submerge the gate; Spring thunder reverberates through the branches. Throughout my life, countless things happen; Not just the white clouds know them all."

    "translate": "The sun flows for the workers, visiting the leaves in confusion. Although you have a sentence like me, your heart is not like yours. Constructing the forest and green bamboo, the thatched cottage warms the clouds. When will we go together, with a group of deer in a thousand mountains?"

    "translate": "It is said that living in the mountains is good, and the book room is surrounded by green. The burning flames surround the coastal islands, and the brothers and sisters chant under the moonlight. Dogs bark as the yellow date trees fall, and cattle return to the deep red trees. We still hear many white mushrooms, allowing us to search for them together."
