Embracing the many nuances of life, I strive for elegance and avoid superficiality. Since ancient times, heroes have flourished, and today's cities sing their praises. Who has come close to understanding the depths, and who possesses the talents of the past? My secluded atmosphere weighs on me, and I lament the loss of friends. Drunkenness and intoxication wash away my sorrow, as I sink deeper into bliss. My wit is often wasted, as I struggle to find worthy companions. I do not wish to hurt others, nor do I want to be ashamed by forcing a smile. Like Guan Yu, I face challenges, while Dong Zhuo lies asleep in his tower.

With jade steps and lotus flowers, one doesn't consider themselves light, and the cold eyes cannot give further instructions. Holding a jade cup and pouring red pearls, one drunkenly enjoys themselves among the flowers; it is not easy to plan such a feast, and after returning, one's heart is entangled for ten days. The Lanling family style is similar to the imperial capital, and it also emerges from the city of flowers. The willow waist travels ten thousand miles with the wind, and where is there no return journey? Let the iron heart of Song Guangping enjoy the plum blossoms at night while wiping away his drunken eyes. The art of singing and dancing in Zhao is more refined, and it cannot be evaluated whether it blocks the clouds or returns the snow. There are no more than a few fairy maiden in the world, and the naked eye is amazed by the game of immortals. I don't care about the glory of ten thousand bells, and I am intoxicated by wine and flowers as if I were in Penglai. What is the need for a grand gathering with four things, and one can write high emotions with bare feet. I hate that Su Dongpo is a public official in the world, and his family reputation often tips the nine barbarians. Among the fashionable crowd, he puts down his weapons and asks his neighbor to hold his wine cup. When will the high tower bell sound, as my heart is drunk like spring dew?"

The small pond gathers its springs, the tall building echoes with the chirping of young swallows. The wind enters the pine trees, creating a quiet atmosphere; flowers add to the lushness of the bamboo shadows.

The east wind changes the forest and fields; we cultivate the land with plows. Green arrowheads emerge from the white water, and the wide ponds connect to the vast fields. Various flowers cover the long slopes, and wild grasses twine through the secluded paths. Saline soil turns into fertile ground, and dead branches sprout tender shoots. The trees are filled with warbling birds, and the deep woods are home to deer and their young. The journey seems endless, and the sun is setting. Philosophers strive for achievement, while common people cling to simplicity. Eventually, I will put away my dusty carriage and clean myself at a spring-fed stream."

Words and laughter echo on the jade steps; life's changes are taken lightly. Behind the red gates, rows of ornate lances stand; nobles fill the seats with their guests. The bells and belts jingle softly, as horses with white saddlebags gallop by. Thousands of measures of wine are not known to be expensive; half-drunk, we invite all for a joyful time. The silver candles glow brightly as night goes on; serving girls pour spring wine from golden vessels. The spring wine glows like amber, with the scent of orchids and musk in the air. Looking down at the shining wrists reflecting from the silk sleeves, hearing the clear songs rising from the apricot beams. You do not see the twin braids of the beautiful women; each one surpasses Zhao Feiyan. Raising the cup, the peach blossom skirt moves; powder is applied gently with the joyous fan. As the midnight bell chimes, drunk, you hear it; riding together, the dawn light splits apart. The twin towers are shrouded in mist and smoke; the five streets are filled with chaos of carriages and horses. Ending the day, the bells and belts ring out; today is still as joyful as yesterday. Year after year, we enjoy ourselves freely; as we leave, the road shines with light. A single person's happiness is enough; the glory of nine generations is truly admirable. A man should fulfill his desires in time; closing the door and lowering the curtain, people are unaware.

The stars support the emperor's seat, and the sword and shoes protect the heavenly mechanism. The bright golden waves are missing, and the heavy jade leakage is rare. Colored papers sit on fierce beasts, and painted fans are lined up with famous peacocks. The cause of the industry is important in ink and color, and the favor of the rain and dew is fine. The three platforms shine brightly, and the unity of virtue celebrates the clothes. The prosperous fortune looks forward to culture and education, and the bold plan originates from the martial vigor. Outstanding achievements are like distant belts, and the beautiful atmosphere is like smoke. Upholding integrity without hiding, we still follow the advice together. It is a good time to serve our ruler, and the Ming Mountains shine brilliantly."

    "translate": "Ming dynasty, born Shen Fu; inheriting the family, assisting Yu and Tang. Temple counsel, bearing the breath of the universe; military laws, moving like frost in the clear sky. Bell and pottery achievements are great, mountains and rivers oaths are long. Elegant demeanor, dominating like a tiger; graceful steps, surpassing the dragon. The way cooperates with the power of the clay pot; the favor returns to the sunlight and the moonlight. One word promotes the country and state; nine commands are prepared for the jade tablet. Good governance, the army is more disciplined; benevolence spreads, all things are healthy. Red gates, heavy gates and halberds; vermilion edicts, half silk. Position, controlling the cloud and dragon fields; general, arriving at the Zhuo Lu countryside. Shooting eagles, the sky is even greener; blowing horns, the pass remains yellow. Deep into the peaceful road; horizontally opening up the Han territory. The achievements are far away from the true stone; the fame shines through the colored silk. Looking at the polecat's courage on the broken dunes; recognizing the phoenix by the pool. Dance waist, gathered in the elegant pavilion; song sound, caressing the carved beam. Clear cups passed down to the parrots; bright furs shining on the soprano swan. Reciting poetry with a white feather fan; practicing hunting with a green gun. Beautiful scenery, a land for beautiful people; sandy wastelands, a place for brave soldiers. Inviting Xie Yan to the tent; gaining Zhou Gan under the banner. Pearls reflect the empty sky; jades reflect the fragrance of the seat. Wang Hun knows Wuzi; Chen Shi encourages Yuanfang. Wealth and honor, endless spring; joy and entertainment, endless night. Stringed instruments follow the jade tent; wine is served by golden seals. Civil affairs do not need to be urged; border cities do not need to be guarded. The military looks magnificent in the desert; the public looks majestic in the rock corridor. The field of dreams is next to the island; the river terrace overflows with thousands of rooms. Dawn flowers split the Jasper Stone; autumn colors enter Hengyang. The distant city confuses the dark rabbit; the clear stream distinguishes the white wolf. Loyal and virtuous people are moved; past and present are vast and vast. The dyke holds the red lotus; the bridge divides the green willow row. Cars and litters come and go; pavilions and gardens are dense and matching. Fine mats cool off the hot summer; high rooms lead to early coolness. Listening to the zither, one knows that one thinks quietly; saying that the sword makes one feel energetic. Beautiful scenery on the Yan Tower; clear light on Zhengyi posthouse. Drum and trumpet noise in the north; jade and jade reflect the east bed. Dare to show off Yuci's zither; gladly follow the wall given by the emperor. Official position, thinking of taking a shortcut; winning in battle, deserving to enter the hall. Wanting to fly with three years' wings; frequently turning back a night's intestines. Wiping anxiety with wine; riding the wind, letting oneself be crazy with poetry. Planting peach and lime trees in the world; bearing rice and millet in the world. Under the meaning of the door, who knows in the boundless world."

Awakening from slumber, I remove my phoenix pin. The violet orchid is wet with autumn dew, and the yellow crane is shrouded in evening clouds. The remnants of my former life are overgrown with weeds, as cold mountains emerge from the distant woods. In the bright moonlight, I often stay in temples, and in turbulent times, I play the zither again in sorrow. I believe that the heavens and the earth should be together, and the way of literature and wisdom has not been lost. I wait for the clear sky at the Heavenly Gate, and when the warm clouds open, my chest is wide."

The canopy and banners follow the whole family as they leave, while the piano and books lead the way. I meet happiness on the Cangzhou River, and the bright moon shines upon Prince Yuan. The phoenix and the crane will eventually soar over the Han Dynasty, and the serpent and dragon will emerge from their pools. The fragrant orchid blooms with the dawn, and the pine trees tolerate the cold during migration. The world admires your accomplishments, and you are greeted by the courtly etiquette. Enjoy your meals and keep well, as the green waters meander on."

They fight against stealthy attacks deep in enemy territory, and prepare for spring defenses in the distant passes. With a lowly body, where can they turn for help? In the vast sky, they only hurt themselves. When their work is done, they are rewarded as favored generals; when their strength is spent, they return to poor villages.

Our tents are filled with wool, just like our treasured items are displayed in ornate dishes. Our loyalty shines through our familiarity with both foreign customs and Han officials. The land is clean of ice mice, while the sky reflects the cold radiance of the fire-breathing dragon. Our celebrations differ from those of Su Qing, as our music is unique from that of Cai Nu. The Gobi Desert divides into yellow expanses, while the Great Wall reaches its extreme limits. We enjoy the flavors of savory foods, as we listen to the sounds of different cultures. We await our return like the geese, as we embark on our journey like the mighty pigeon. Our hearts are far from each other, as the western palace struggles with their tasks. Beautiful words are woven in silk and brocade, as precious items are hidden among the pearls. Hundreds of soldiers leave their camps, as thousands of horses enter the royal enclosure.

The vast stars guide us northward, as greatness and dominance have always been difficult to conquer."

Scattered through a thousand tree leaves, melting away the dust on the nine streets. The pure flowers gather in the powdery offices, the clear air surrounds the frost-covered platforms. Clearly feeling the snow accumulate against the windowpanes, coldly knowing it has reached the border. The Xie family competes to imitate cotton, mistakenly astonished by the plum blossoms over the mountains. The dim moonlight faintly illuminates, the strong wind gradually urges. Gradually sealing off the yellow bamboo shoots, gathering up the purple orchids first. The Sun Room faces the writing screen, Liang Garden sips wine from the cup. Quietly embracing the jade trees, drunkenly recalling the white mountains. The green paths are filled with hungry crows, the distant clouds hold the mournful geese. At this time, I am on night duty, my longing thoughts wander freely."

    "translate": "Emperor Ascends the Throne, All Things Submit. The sun shines when it is said to shine, and the rain falls when it is said to rain. In this first year, there was a bandit in the summer. He wanted to take over his territory, following the footsteps of the past. The emperor said, \"Ah, could it not be me?\" To bear the blame is difficult, and to let it go is not allowed. Send out the army to attack them, with ten companies. Stationed below the city walls, they announce the blessings and calamities. Their ranks are broken, and they dare not gather together. They throw their heads out from the city walls, and the white flag is raised at night. Among the dangers outside the borders, none is greater than the land of Shu. Wei Gao leaves the post, and Liu Pi guards behind. Blood is spilled in his teeth, and he refuses to open his mouth. Open the treasury and feed the soldiers, saying that you can take whatever you want. You stretch your bow, you beat your drums, you write a letter asking me to lead you. When the matter first reached the ears, everyone was angry. The emperor said, \"Yes, alas, the distant men and women. If you can attach yourself and be at peace, then you will be given. Read the edict in the court, and give the military rank to the lesser official. You will leave the capital in the morning and arrive at its location in the evening. Li Pi happily tells his allies, \"You will rise and form a squad. We can have the whole of Shu, and this should not be accepted. Ten thousand oxen are grilled and roasted, ten thousand earthenware jars are used for wine. Wrapped in silk, wrapped in red silk. Some are afraid of its violence, some are tempted by its lure. When they leave, there are tens of thousands of them. They then attacked Dongchuan and occupied the city barriers. The emperor sighed, \"It can't be allowed.\" I ordered General Chongwen, and divided the troops to prevent and control. Calm their drive, do not ravage my fields. Move at a rate of thirty miles per day, and slowly move to the right. Li Pi's allies meet and discuss, maintaining the deer's head as a guard. Chongwen follows the imperial decree, advancing and retreating in accordance with the rules. Fight without being greedy for slaughter, capture without indiscriminate numbers. The four armies are in order, like a large haystack. On August 26th, Li Pi abandoned the city and fled. Carrying his wife and concubines, wrapping up his children. That day, Chongwen entered the house. Scatter and chase after them, search for the original and pick out the hidden places. When Li Pi was cornered and desperate, he had nowhere to hide. Looking down at the river, he couldn't see any islands. He fell down, like a pestle thrown into a mortar. Taken to the river, handcuffed and shackled. Women are crying and kneeling, offering themselves to the emperor. Show the city to everyone, let them see everything. Unchain them, put them between anvil and hammer. Weak children, bent over and walking with red cloth on their legs. Pull their heads and feet, cut their waists first. Then do the same to their followers, their bodies support each other. Finally, they took Li Pi, frightened sweaty. Cutlery is scattered, cutting meat is shared. Prizes are awarded to the generals and officers, holding the sword and tying the silk. Silk piles up in their homes, grain fills their granaries. Mourn for the fallen, give food and clothing to the widows and orphans. Posthumously bestow titles and graves, thoroughly and widely. Through the fought-over land, relieve rent books. Issue orders to reward achievements, quickly and fiercely like fire. In the middle of heaven and earth, all things follow their proper order. From Youyuan in the east to the sea in the west. From south to Xu and Cai, all non-Chinese barbarians. Trembling in awe, bowing and dancing. Cast away weapons and armor, privately enjoying feasts. Come and ask for an audience, dozens of couples. Emperor sighs, uncle and cousins. Each occupy your positions, train the farmers. On the first day of the first month, we first see our ancestors. I perform all the rites, ascending and descending, bowing and paying homage. Offer it to the new palace, looking at the roof beams. Sad to see her face, tears fall into the dish. The courtiers who serve me, help me feel sad. It is offered to the high god on the eastern altar on the first day of the lunar month. Remove it from the southern part of the country, like scales and feathers. Set up tents all around, revealing the intricate patterns. Beasts are in conflict, the round altar is neat and tidy. The heavenly army is spread out, the banners are graceful. Twelve dragons drive, fish-like elegance. At night, they ascend the hill and offer a sacrificial bottle. The public music starts, noisy and melting. Purple flames, the high god descends. The stars follow the seat, scattered and extravagant. Sun God and Moon Goddess, shining and serving. Dishonored ghosts, misty and vast. Feast on aromatic meat, produce auspicious blessings. The phoenix responds, patting its wings. Red unicorns and yellow dragons, winding and intertwined. Officials and common people, old and young. They jump and cheer, losing their happiness and choking. Dry clean and cut off dust, erase flaws. Continue the heir of the loyal general, promote the old and wise. Foster the helpless, generously spread mercy. The emperor is divine, understanding past and present. Hear and see clearly, just like Yao and Yu. Born with the law, move appropriately. Heaven bestows the emperor as the ruler of the world. Nurture and raise them all, no difference between the small and the big. Billions of years, dare to disobey. The emperor is humble and diligent, washing and cleaning earthenware. Get rid of extravagance, like this silk. Order the four directions, extravagence will have bad consequences. Heaven bestows the emperor, abundant wheat and millet. No summoning floods and droughts, consumed by birds and mice. Billions of years, rich without poverty. The emperor is upright, distinguishing between good and evil. Rebellious and insane, it has been cut off and removed. Drive all the villains away, no remnants left. Heaven bestows the emperor, numerous ministers and assistants. Broadly consult and view afar, placed beside you. Billions of years, no one dares to insult. The emperor is great in filial piety, loving and friendly. Joyfully happy, serving the empress. Wet and permeate all, reaching nine parts. Heaven bestows the emperor, equal to heaven's longevity. Reaching this peace, don't be lazy for a long time. Billions of years, father and mother. Doctor, I am more, I am a language expert. Writing poems, matched Ji Fu."

    "translate": "I have heard of the southern capital, where the mountains are enclosed. The east and west borders the sea, and its vastness is hard to comprehend in detail. The mountain scriptures and geographical records are vague and confused, not easily transmitted. I try to summarize them, hanging one thought on thousands of gaps. Wanting to stop, I realize that I cannot, so I roughly narrate what I have experienced. I once ascended a high hill and saw them closely gathered. Clear and bright, their edges appear, like fine threads divided into embroidery. Steamy mists merge together, revealing the inner and outer layers suddenly. Without wind, it naturally shakes and stirs, warm and moist. Horizontal clouds occasionally coagulate, dripping dewdrops on several peaks. The sky floats with long eyebrows, thick green painted freshly. Alone, there is a steep and extreme place, where the sea is bathed by the pigeon's beak. In spring, the sun warms the muddy ground, and the water clears and reveals its deep charm. Although the rocks are steep, they are soft and weak, like containing alcohol. In summer, all things flourish, and shade adds to cover. The divine spirit breathes out constantly, and the clouds compete to build. In autumn, frost likes to carve, making thin and bony figures stand tall. Irregularly stacked, they confront each other in the universe. In winter, although it is quiet and dark, the ice and snow are skillfully carved. New sunlight shines on the tall and dangerous, billions of meters always high and long. Day and night have no stationary state, and the moment changes the situation. The majestic Taibai Mountain rises in the southwest, without interruption. The viceroy's palace is equipped with moral fate, occupying the ding and wu houses. Leaping over the earth position, he falls into the dry pit of heaven. Vacuum and cold, carefully searching for breath. The sun is burning, and the cold frost is rising and mixing. North of the Dajiang Lake, you can meet it occasionally in clear days. Connecting endlessly, you can lean down and watch as if stuck in clear bubbles. The slight ripple moves the water surface, and the jumping and restless monkeys rush about. With concern, we cherish the broken pieces, and with joy, we do not fall backward. Previously, I walked through the Du Villa Path, which was blocked and primitive. After a long climb, I can enjoy the wealth of views. Walking will soon reach the end, and the mountains and lands are troublesome to walk. Suddenly, I want to break free, but it is difficult to forgive and forgive. Giant Spirit and boastful moth, far away, expect to sell necessarily. I still doubt the intention of creation, which protects and preserves our essence. Although I can support it, lightning is afraid of abuse. Climbing and getting off, I reach the accumulated tiles. As if trying to raise my head, the earth blocks and creates confusion. The dignity of the appearance is lost, and newness is close to oldness. Counting the days and months in office, I want to advance but cannot. Therefore, I take the opportunity to peek at the pond, where the water is deep and the creatures are hidden. Fish and shrimp can be picked up, and divine creatures dare not rob. Falling leaves from the trees, and birds are startled to save them. They compete to fly with rings in their mouths, throwing them quickly to feed their young. Returning home, I look back, and the strong shoots grow again. It is amazing and strange, and its solid nature can change. Previously, I was accused and punished, and I accidentally met during exploration. Initially, I entered from Lantian, looking around and straining my neck. At that time, it was dark and snowing, and my eyes were struggling with confusion. The steep path was pulled out, as if hanging on a slope. I raised my clothes and stepped forward, stumbling back and forth. I miss the distant view, and I only pay attention to the left and right. The bamboo and sugarcane shout, and the bright armor is gathered. I focus on remembering the flat road, escaping danger and unpleasant smells. Recently, I encountered a clear day, and my former wishes were happy to be fulfilled. Climbing the top of the tomb, I flash among the field mice. Lowering my head, I can see the wide mess, which is scattered everywhere. Some are like friends, some like followers, some are like ships, and some are like horses. Some are scattered like shattered bamboo, and some are like hot needles. Some are mixed like painting, and some are winding like seal script. Some are like stars, and some are like clouds. Some float like waves, and some are like hoes. Some are like Ben Yi, who competes bravely before buying, and some are slow and angry. Some are like emperors, gathering courtiers. Although they are close, they are not familiar, and they are not far away. Some are like food on a tray, and some are like graves. Some are like exposed turtles, and some are like sleeping beasts. Some are like hidden dragons, and some are like fighting eagles. Some are like friends, and some follow. Some are like refugees, and some look back. Some are like enemies, and some are like spouses. Some are like hats, and some are like dancing sleeves. Some are like battlefields, and some are surrounded by hunts. Some flow eastward like water, and some lie northward like a reclining lion. Like fire, it burns, and like gas, it is fine. Some walk without stopping, and some are left behind. Some leaner than others, some longer than others. Some red like bald patches, some smoke like firewood. Some are like divination, and some are like splits. Some are ahead, like peels, and some are cut off behind, like encounters. Extending and belonging, splitting and meeting again. Mouths of fish in the water, falling and staying in the moon. Trees on the walls, mounts on carriages. Sharp and sharp, sharpened swords and spears. Bright and bright, bright stones and gems. Flowers blooming, and the roof collapses. Peacefully comfortable, foolishly crazy. Running and running, frightened and not working. Greatly established between heaven and earth, managing and operating the skin and muscles. Who initially opened and stretched it? Who encouraged and served it? Creating this simple and clever, working hard to endure fatigue. Is it not using an axe, or pretending to curse? There is no transmission of the great chaos, and the work is too great to be repaid. I have heard from the temple officials, and the incense is dropped and enjoyed. Elegantly, I write poems, only to express gratitude."

    "translate": "Nanchong County, Guozhou, the cold daughter Xie Ziran. Childish and ignorant, only hearing of the gods. Lightly learning their skills, it is in Jinquan Mountain. The bustling and prosperous admiration is gone, abandoning the love and kindness of parents. Concentrating and feeling the demons, the confused and difficult things are hard to describe. One day sitting in an empty room, the clouds and mist arise between them. As if listening to the melody of a pipe, coming from the depths of heaven. The bright day turns dark, the wind whispers cold. The roof beams flicker briefly, the five colors of light connect. Those who watch are just amazed, hesitating to dare to approach. Soon they lightly rise, floating like smoke in the wind. Vastly across the eight corners of the world, there is no way to affect each other. The town clerk reported the matter, the county magistrate was surprised and sighed. Driving his car with the officials, the common people competed to go first. Entering the door, there was nothing to see, hats and shoes were like shed snakeskins. All said that it was a divine thing, brightly believed to be passed on. I heard in ancient times, the Summer Queen knew the divine through symbols. The people could enter the forests, but the monsters would not meet her. Staggering, no longer vibrating, the later generations were free to deceive. The dark and bright mix up, the living and the dead fight each other. Although Emperor Qin was keen, Emperor Hanwu was its source. Since the two emperors came, this disaster has been connected. Strange changes occur in wood and stone, foxes and hares exhibit their evil. No one can fully live their life, how can they last longer? Life is in all things, knowledge is the best. How can we not trust ourselves, but want to follow things? What is done cannot be regretted, the lonely soul holds deep hatred. What is yet to come can be warned, my words are not empty words. There are normal rules in life, men and women have their own order. Warm clothes and food when hungry, spinning and weaving, planting and plowing. Below to protect your children, above to serve your ancestors and parents. If you deviate from this path, you will abandon your body. Alas, that cold girl, forever entrusted to a different group. Her sadness turned into a poem, those in the dark should write it down on their sleeves."

Fame is still a source of shame, taste is thin but I am truly fortunate. Perhaps leaving regrets behind, this is the secluded screen."

    "translate": "Emperor Wu, once exiled, wept blood for his sins. Unaware of the vastness, I drift like a raft on the ocean. Sometimes I doubt if I have submitted a memo, but where did it come from? This year, the capital is suffering from a drought, and crops are scarce. The emperor is compassionate for the people with no food, and half of the taxes are exempted. The government is concerned about the costs, but they still need to collect taxes. The rich are in a hurry, while the poor have already fled. Rumor has it that children are abandoned in the streets and drained canals. Men are sold for a handful of rice, and no one is willing to pay. I saw it myself on the road, so many hungry people. I stood by the roadside and watched the dead lie there, and I returned home unable to eat, as if I were hooked. Just at the time of the inspector, I was truly ready for action in autumn. I offered my memo and moved to the gate, loyal to my duty. I presented the people's suffering, making sure their voices were not silenced. I also presented the importance of the root system in the capital region. The snow provides evidence of a bountiful harvest, and I hope you will be patient with the silk worms. The emperor was touched, and the chief constable sighed. They said they would implement it immediately, but they ended up moving to the hot southern region. My colleagues are all talented, especially Liu and Liu. Some worry that their words may leak, leading to misunderstandings and accusations. The imperial envoy came, and there was no time to stay. My sick sister was lying on the bed, separated from life by a veil. She sobbed and begged to say goodbye, but I could not nod. My weak wife was holding our child, and she came out to pay her respects, forgetting her shame. I did not look back as I walked to Lianzhou. I went from a scholar to an old prisoner. In the winter of Jidong, the ice freezes the roads. The spring breeze rages in the Dongting Lake, frightening the lonely boat. I crossed the mountains to take my post, offering my face to serve my lord. The bitterness of cold is nothing, it gives birth to sores and warts. The people in the distant places are different, and the officials and people are like monkeys. The wild and vicious are full of anger, and their tongues are busy with jokes. Under the sun, two owls fight on the roof. There are snakes with two heads, and there are groups of scorpions flying around. In the dead of winter, you sometimes fan yourself, and in midsummer, you sometimes wear a heavy coat. The hurricane is the most terrifying, it shakes the hills. Thunder and lightning add to the light and brightness, and the atmosphere is difficult to compare. The plague suddenly attacks, and no one recovers from it in ten households. Suspicion and hatred lead to poison, and when facing the case, there is anxiety. Previously, I was pardoned, but I was worried and happy. Sure enough, I was tied up again, and I could not go back to plow. This office is powerful and large, filled with spears and shields. I am a lowly clerk, where do I find dignity? In my life, I have aspired to benevolence and righteousness, and I have studied Confucius. I knew early on that I would not become a high official. What's more, I am close to the prisons, beating thieves and catching them. I know that I am losing power, and I fear I will be caught in the net. The Xiang river is clear and swift, and the cool wind blows daily. Why do I hesitate to return to my hometown? The other day, the emperor sent a message, and the crown prince passed it on. He issued an order clearly, punishing the first sinners, including Dou. I also heard that the elite are wearing tall hats and entering the ranks. The ranks are respectful again, and the jade pendants ring like jade. Waiting for the righteous rule of Zhengguan, the frontier will be free of helmets. The three wise men follow the emperor, and they are outstanding among Mei and Zou. High-minded discussions participate in creation, and the clear texts shine the imperial plan. United hearts support the sage emperor, and the roots are fine. The minor poetry sings the deer, and the apple tree values the lowing cattle. The legacy is remote and not inherited, and it does not remember the experience of sharing a bed. If your ambition fails, you will be replaced by a younger person. Since my teeth have been missing, I have longed for flexible tongue. Because of my illness, my nose is blocked, and gradually I can tolerate perfume and odor. I deeply reflect and decide to resign, and I will die by the pine and cypress. I cannot achieve my dreams, only to see the years go by. The emperor Wen of the Yin pitied the birds and animals and prayed for spiders and scorpions. Lei Huan dug out the treasure sword, and the vengeance fog disappeared. This way is really admirable, but who can borrow it before? I humbly answer my friend, the bright moon is not dark."

Thinking back to when I did not know you, Meng Jun came from the south. Proud of what he had achieved, he said that you had articles. My name belongs to the imperial court, but I cannot go there. I long for your company but cannot see you. The time is like the moon's death, and winter morning is in the room. Driving public affairs away, I heard that you were just arriving at the city. I ordered a carriage to bring you here, and I invited you to sit in the middle hall. Opening your heart to listen to your words, often meeting expectations. Confucius has been dead for a long time, and the way of benevolence and righteousness has been deserted for a long time. Various schools have emerged, and strange and bizarre things are rampant. Elders stick to what they have heard, and young people have become accustomed to it. It is difficult to find someone who knows less, and pure ancientness has long been lost. Just like planting trees in the garden, roots make them easy to grow. Keep them and don't let them go, house them by the city gate. Before the year is over, you can watch the vast river and lake. People point to laugh, saying that I don't understand. Children are afraid of thunder and lightning, and fish and turtles are scared by night lights. The state raises scholars, and the selection test is inappropriate. I respond to your strategy, what a brilliant chapter. General Zhao serves in the morning, and the banquet sings the deer song. After the ceremony ends and the music ends, we bow and send each other off in the courtyard. You leave in a moment, and your reputation flows brilliantly. I secretly rejoice and sigh, knowing that you have achieved something. Human affairs cannot be constant, and suddenly it hurts me. When you passed the exam, it was just after the death of the deputy governor. Sad emotions meet happy words, and I am dizzy and unable to deal with it. At night, I stay in the west of Yanshi, turning on the bed. In the night, I hear the chaos in Biangzhou, and I walk around the wall anxiously. At that time, my wife and children were left behind, and I couldn't take them with me. I can't meet again, and I will be scattered and suffer. My arrogant son hasn't stopped nursing, and I can't forget it. Suddenly it seems like it's with me, and my ears seem to hear its cry. Can I turn back halfway? One day can't change. Eventually, I hear from the east that my family is spared from misfortune. I take a boat down the Bian River and head east to Pengcheng. I pass the funeral and arrive in Luoyang, but I can't stop and return. I take a detour through the alliance port, and I walk along the valleys. The sun sets and enters the military gate, and the weak horse stumbles and is about to die. The host wishes to stay for a while, and he is invited into the hall to offer wine. I dare not refuse, my heart is crazy. Drinking and eating, I don't know the taste, and the strings and pipes are loud. At dawn, I leave, as if I were a frightened duck taking off. I stop by the Shi River at dusk, wanting to cross but there is no boat. I call loudly for a long time before I can swim across the river at night. The middle of the river is shallow, and the sand and water are unclear. The waves surprise each other, and the stars and constellations turn over. The wheels of the cart squeak, and the servants cry around. On the day of the zodiac, I rest at Shi Men, and I peek at the dragon fighting at the spring. I go east to the south of Chen and Xu, and I step on the bank. I don't meet anyone on the road, and the cocks crow. I walk for two months, and I will reach the south of Xu. I get off my horse and walk on the bank, and I get on a boat and pay homage to my brother. Who says that it is difficult to experience hardships, and there is no one hundred people. The marshal lives in the south of Yang, and his home is on the Si River. There is clothes in the sack, and there is food in the bucket. Closing the door, I read books and history, and the windows and doors are cool. I long for your visit every day, do you know my feelings? Parting is not long, and hardships and hardships are experienced. I don't eat enough, and I listen without getting tired. For thirty days, I sit in the morning and watch the five clears. My friends and a few others serve in the western capital. Dong Ye peeps at the Yu cave, and Li Ao watches the tide of the river. Thousands of miles away, can we meet and gather? The Huai River flows, and the Chu Mountains are dense. You leave again, my heart is where to lose. The male does not get stronger, and a hundred years passes like a gust of wind. I can still pursue high ranks, and I don't have to stay in one place."

Alas, there is no wine, only solitary drinking and reciting poems. Sadly, time passes quickly, and the seasons change relentlessly. I sing of a nobleman's journey, looking to the past and present."

Heaven does not respond in vain, fortune and misfortune follow each other. I want to present my advice, but there is no way to reach the red steps. With my heart as paper and my blood as ink, I write of ancient sages like Yao and Shun, and draw parallels to mythical creatures like dragons and tortoises. My words are passionate and impassioned, my writing is sparse and unrefined. The more I read, the more I wonder. Although dill is considered delicious, offering it to the emperor is foolish. My thoughts are sealed in my bones, and I can only feel empty curiosity. I arrived in the capital, often accompanying fine horses. I met many talented people, and our discussions were flawless. They treated me with great respect, but I couldn't shake off my rough exterior. I held my tongue, waiting patiently for an opportunity. Returning to the battlefield, I looked around in surprise like a captive bird. For days, I didn't speak, and all morning I was deceived.

Taking off their caps and cutting their hair, they fly and leave traces behind. Starting a career in the four bright lights, climbing to the sky and entering the autumn sky. They eventually ascend to the Heavenly Platform to gaze, with all the valleys jagged and rugged. Sleeping on the highest peak at night, looking up at the stars. The light shines brightly, with stars arranged in rows from north to south. This place is free of birds and beasts, naturally strict and divine. The slight breeze blows through the wood and stones, creating a sound like the surging waves. At midnight, I get up and look down, seeing the sea waves holding the sun's disc. Fish and dragons are startled and leap, their cries turning into sorrow and bitterness. Strange energies sometimes appear in purple and red, rubbing together and rotating. The golden crow rises and soars, making the six realms fresh and clean. I have heard of the wonders of the Yu Cave, heading east to peek at Ou and Min. The customs in the region are not fond of antiquity, leading to the loss of its authenticity. The hidden tracks are hard to find, and the path of the saints is lamented to be long buried. I return to the Zhejiang River, standing tall and towering over the Emei Mountains. My strong will does not die, lasting a thousand years like a morning apart. What is right and wrong? It doesn't matter. Leaving it behind isn't part of my nature. Crossing the river to visit Luoyang, wandering widely and exploring. The steep peaks are lost in the clouds, and the hills and dales sink into the lake. It's raining for the first time after the weather clears, and the cascading waterfalls hang like silk ribbons in the sky. Last year, I went to the Luofu Mountain, stepping on the southern tip of the South Sea. The great yang energy is flourishing, leaving spring forever vibrant. The large birds soar with their long feathers, and the whales play with their long fins. Since coming to the Lianzhou Temple, I have never reached the city gates. I bring the blue cloud guest, exploring the edges of the cliffs. The governor invited me but I didn't go, and the group of officials asked me frequently. I have no money, but I think the rich are poor. Suddenly yesterday, I couldn't find him, and I asked his neighbors. I chased after him and asked about it. Looking at me, he was happy and did not differ from ordinary people. Parting is natural since ancient times, and farewell is not worth treasuring. I hear that the Nine Suspense is wonderful, and my ambition now wants to be fulfilled. The spotted bamboo weeps for the Shun wife, and the clear Xiang River sinks the Chu minister. Mount Heng and Dongting Lake, these are places where the way goes. I am going to search for the Song Mountain and arrive in Luoyang, and then travel to Qin. I float and wander without a fixed place, and occasionally I can go wherever I want. I tell you to go, but your way is not my following. The river fish cannot live out of the pond, and the wild birds are difficult to tame. I am not a follower of the Western Teaching, but I pity your madness and innocence. I despise lazy travelers and pity your foolishness and persistence. We are going different ways, why are you splashing your face with water?"

Government officials do not control them, instead they are free to follow their own paths. Farming and sericulture gradually lose their laborers, as officials occasionally send forth their talents. Master Huangfu, with his royal lineage, has long been involved in books and history, and is able to compose literary works at an early age. Disappointed in the middle, he loses his way and moves forward slowly. His ambition is unbound by education, and he soars above worldly concerns. He plays chess, focusing on white and black, and lives or dies based on chance. Six-sided dice are cast, and the winner is determined by chance. Who can compete with his battle poems, with their vast and abundant imagery? He drinks wine, and his wit and humor are always fresh. Sometimes he gets drunk under the flowers and the moon, singing loudly and clearly. Everyone is silent, and it seems like a string is being played. He searches for victories without fear of danger, repeatedly following the course of the Qianjiang River. In June, the lightning surprises the boats, and the angry water suddenly splits in two, falling into a deep spring. The water flows more quickly, and you can see the round sky above. You throw yourself in, not caring about your life, willing to sacrifice it. The waves and foam churn, and you are reborn in the water. Twenty people travel together, their souls and bones buried in a pit. Master Huangfu does not care, continuing his journey through the path. Li, the governor of Kai and Zhong, often shares his poetry and writing. He loses his position, but still composes for you. He spends time with you, surrounded by beautiful women. Yesterday, you arrived in Lin Yi, where the governor frequently holds banquets. You meet three or four guests, filled with gifts of orchids. You enjoy the lakes and rivers, stopping at the streams. Goodbyes are not allowed, and your skirts are constantly pulled. Neighbors compete to invite you, and letters fly. In October, you go down the Gui Mountain, enjoying the cold and exploring. King Wang, the outsider, welcomes you, taking you in first. Since you have entered the guesthouse, your jealousy has long been able to dominate. We bring our blankets, enjoying each other's company. Hearing stories of the two capitals, everything is clear in front of you. Rumors and superstitions mix, and all are considered. Your talent is truly a pity, as you polish and refine your red paint. You are about to gather your things and leave, ready to wear your hat. Li, the governor of Shao Yang, walks high in the clouds. He enjoys the company of guests, forgetting to eat, and opens his bag to ask for silk money. He holds the southern official's narrative, with words carved in jade. Ancient energy combines with the Tao, and high standards crush the Great Mystery. You board a boat to pay your respects, reading and feeling better. It's like meeting an old friend, pouring wine and discussing hidden sorrows. Because of this, you stay longer, when will your horse be whipped?"

The beams and pillars are magnificent and beautiful, but the structure eventually declined. The old man came late, singing for a long time before responding.

Felling bamboo to channel the spring, building corridors along the cliffs. It's late autumn, but the heat has not yet subsided. Together, we forget about rank and status, abandoning social constraints. The guest hall is filled with coolness, comfortable mattresses lie upon clean mats. Cooking vegetables from the creek, including herbs and water caltrop. I, who have long admired these sights, am fortunate to be able to accompany them.

I reflect on Qu Yuan's descent, recalling Jia Yi's banishment. Peppers and orchids compete in jealousy, vermilion and spruces conspire in slander. Who could have caused such sorrow to well up in my heart, causing tears to fill my face? My wings flap helplessly, struggling to remove flaws. Wearing ermine as an official, one governs with responsibility, similar to dividing the provinces. Treating the worthy with honor is so superior, while serving oneself modestly and frugally. The great mansion's beams are rising, the massive river's oars are cutting through the water. In planning and constructing, there is truly little time for leisure; however, gatherings for enjoyment are already lacking.

It accumulates for a distance of 700 miles, embracing various forms. Since ancient times, it has never been clear, mixed around without a direction. The hot wind searches and stirs up strange creatures, creating a great commotion. A huge wave rises, obstructing the universe. Tall mountains and lush trees rise, competing for strength. The sound is so loud, like the sound of thousands of cars. It seems like the music of the ancient emperor Huang Di, with the dragons and snakes revealed in the music. The spirits and ghosts are not of this world, their rhythm is somewhat stumbling. The sun shines brightly, while the darkness feels sad. Passing through the Spring Blossom Gate, you reach the northern edge of the dam. At night, you anchor on the Barling Island, surrounded by weeds. The stars and constellations swim in the water, making it hard to tell which is above and which is below. The remaining waves continue to rage, making noise like the sound of pots and basins. Ascending the Yueyang Tower in the morning, the sun's rays shine brightly. The fierce wind subsides, bringing a calm and quiet atmosphere. The lake is deep and green, reflecting objects skillfully. The river dolphins occasionally appear, causing sudden waves. In the dead of winter, the cold begins to seep into the cracks. You face the nearby shore, sitting idly, unable to see far. Cleansing your soul and spirit, your deep feelings are relaxed and free. The host is an old friend, shaking hands, happy and sad. Rejoice in my return, hoping I am well. They set the table with shoes and hats, enjoying their homemade wine. The cups flow without stopping, the high columns play their songs. Orange and chestnuts are served, along with meat paste and sauce. As the joy ends, sadness arises, making us unable to forget our past. Recalling my past, I wanted to achieve greatness. But I was slandered and driven out, losing my position. Now I have been given a new post, surrounded by generals. I am a slow horse, afraid I will do something wrong. I remember when I first started reading books, I wanted to challenge the king. But I was deceived and slandered, losing my art and my wealth. I love talent, regardless of behavior, always encountering slander. Last year, I left office, this disaster was unjust. The nobles and officials selected empty names, promoting me to recognize the imperial guard. Jealousy and suspicion fear criticism, driving me out and deceiving me. With new favor, I moved to the government's court, living closely with the generals. Alas, I am a lazy horse, fearing I will do something inappropriate. Recalling the time I crossed the Yangtze River, I was willing to die in the fish's belly. The strict schedule forced the wind and sail, shooting arrows into the high waves. Sinking in a moment, who would believe my loyalty and courage? To be alive is really wonderful, controlling myself and punishing myself. Perhaps from today on, I will understand gain and loss. Many things have changed before, there are new interests. I swear to farm ten acres of land, without seeking the position of a millionaire. My little wife knows how to weave silk, and my children can already provide food. Soon, I will retire, asking you to visit me for life and death."

Our paths have been thousands of miles apart, but our bond remains strong. In the countryside, we avoided the war and chaos, and our lives connected through our shared experiences. Our loyalty is like an ancient sword, and our lives are like two floating duckweed on the water. We study and learn from the past, growing and evolving as we go. Our friendship with our peers is like a treasure, and our education is like thundering in our ears. In the morning, we walk on the dew-covered ground, and in the evening, we sleep with the wind whispering through the screens. We make friends with those who are worthy, and we respect our teachers. Our education is like climbing a ladder, and we continue to search for knowledge and understanding. Our curiosity leads us to new discoveries, and our desire for knowledge keeps us motivated. The stones and bridges are smooth and straight, and the sand and water reflect the light. We pick wildflowers in the fields, and we enjoy the subtle flavors of hidden delicacies. We visit temples and climb mountains, and we return to our paths, following the rivers and streams. The clouds and mist create a mysterious atmosphere, and we lose our way among the tall grasses. The floods suddenly change the landscape, and the vast plains appear as if by magic. We build barriers to prevent leaks at night, and we fear the possible attacks during the day. As we leave, we prepare for war, and when we meet again, we celebrate with our comrades. We drink and enjoy ourselves, and we ride horses, ready for action. We part ways, heading off in different directions, but we promise to meet again someday. We say goodbye to the beauty of the flowers in winter, and we wake up to the lights of the palace. We pass through the selection process, and we continue to move forward. We remove the dust from our lives, and our eyes fill with tears once more. We find peace in the city of Luoyi, and we explore the wonders of Mount Hua. We lean on the rocks and look out at the ocean, and we raise our sleeves to brush away the stars. The sun drives back the shadows, and the gods oversee our actions. The springs flow, and the stones shine with a blue light. The steps are slippery with moss, and the wind whispers through the trees. We regret our past mistakes, and we carve our warnings into stone. We are honored to be included, and we are ashamed to be divided. We admire the dedication of others, and we strive to improve ourselves. We travel through the mountains and rivers, and we experience the world around us. The beautiful trees and plants surround us, and the clear waters flow before us. The animals and birds share their homes, and the fish swim near the surface. We continue to learn and grow, and we share our experiences with others. We work hard to communicate and understand one another, and we do not hesitate to spend time together in cold rooms."

Five-word poetry emerged in Han times, Su Li at the forefront. The Eastern Capital gradually spread, with streams of branches. Seven talented writers of the Yan An period, outstanding and changing their style. Meandering to the Jin and Song dynasties, the atmosphere dwindles day by day. Among them are several Bao and Xie poets, closest to the essence. Qi and Liang, Chen and Sui, all works are like cicadas chirping. Searching for spring flowers and plants, imitating and hurting others. In the Zhen dynasty, literature flourished, Shi Lang began to soar. Rising with Li Du, all creatures were oppressed. Later generations continued to be born, each reaching the pinnacle. There was Meng Jiao, who was poor, but had strong talent. Observing ancient and modern times, pursuing hidden delights. Bold words fill the sky, firmly and powerfully pushing away obstacles. Soft and gentle, lavish and indifferent, fiercely rolling up oceanous rain. Glory resembles natural beauty, swift and agile beyond sound. Walking within the rules, willing to endure humiliation and scorn. Mencius distinguishes right from wrong, his eyes clear and sharp. Pure and crisp, it can calm agitation. The bitter and cold Li Yang prefect, fifty or so years old. Eagerly preparing delicious food, working hard for a long time. Who knows him in the popular stream, pointing and laughing at him. The holy emperor seeks the remaining talents, the elite are promoted daily. The hall has an excellent prime minister, loving and caring for everyone. Fortunately, we have Guo Pu and Zhang, lamenting each other's turn. The blue sky sends breath, a strong arrow shoots through Lu cloth. Why haven't you achieved anything for a long time? Tell me your departure date. The frost wind breaks the beautiful chrysanthemum, the beautiful season pursues the hat. I want to leave soon, feeling more attached to things. Those water spinach, please take care of them. The Lu Hou state is small, but the temple's tripod still accepts gifts. We should choose jade, there is no need to discard the coral. My thoughts wander, the banner flutters in the wind. I feel ashamed that I have no way, praying day and night. The crane feather is not born, its transformation lies in hatching. It is easy to chart the passage of waves, easier to transport by a foot. Be good and not eager, only regretting it later. Save life with eight delicacies, it is better to reward one basket. Don't laugh at my micro poetry, God is kind and patient."

I always thought about places to visit, never getting tired of it. The distant land is full of strange things, and the water reflects the sharp stones like swords. The wild flowers are scattered and chaotic, and the dark animals are skilled at leaping and flashing. It's hard to look at, and suddenly I sit dazed. I pray to the gods, not forgetting their power of healing. I dream of the way home, and I walk through the shops in my thoughts. Now I am truly fortunate, with no regrets in my heart. Meng has left, but Hou has yet to arrive. I lean back and listen to the new poem, and the moon shines brightly at the corner of the house. I mix my work, and our tongues are amazed and interlocked. Points out flaws, resisting the city walls. I have been defeated, and I ask to unlock the lead-covered books. I foolishly offer it, considered to be burning like a heavenly flame.

Feeding on jade mountains grain, drinking crystal-clear spring water. Who can be ridden by, an unparalleled treasure. Once upon a time, the Emperor Mu rode it for a distant journey. Wang Ling held the reins, Gao Fu gripped the steering wheel. They spoke of heavenly matters, making people feel confused.

In the evening, I sit firmly until dusk, and only when my hands and eyes are tired do I get up. It's hard to say when I'll move again; it seems that even shrimp and leeches are suspicious. Suddenly, I raise my pole and line, and a fish with scales and fins appears. Today, Houtian and Han Zi sigh and mourn each other for a long time. Now I do everything like this; this is just right for me. In half a lifetime, I hasten to compete for selection; only after one name does the red face fade. Don't you see the world's affairs; in vain, it's all hard work. Take your wife and children with you, and go south to Jiyu without returning. Uncle Qi, your energy is now sharp; my words are urgent, and you mustn't laugh. If you want to fish, you must go far away; big fish will not live in marshy places."

How can I climb a long ladder to pick its fruits and plant its seeds in the Seven Ridges to create a continuous root system?"

The Dongting Lake stretches to the heavens, connected to the Nine Mysterious Mountains; the serpentine dragons and scaly foxes make their presence known. Living nine out of ten times to reach the official place, I live in seclusion, as if hiding from the world. Getting out of bed, afraid of snakes and medicine; the damp sea air, moistening the insects, fills the air with a stench. Yesterday, at the state front, the big drum was struck, the emperor succeeded the throne, pardons were issued for a thousand miles; all capital punishments are removed, those moved and those flowing back are returned. The state family sends a message, forcing our family to suppress it; we can only move to the wilderness of Jing Miao. The judge's subordinate position is unbearable; one cannot avoid being beaten and tortured in the dust. Most of my contemporaries have ascended the path; the heavenly road is dark and dangerous, hard to grasp. Sing your song, and I will sing mine; ours are different, yet both are songs."

In silence, I pray for a response, believing that righteousness can evoke connections. Soon, the peaks emerge from the quiet clearing, towering into the blue sky. The purple canopy connects to the celestial pillar, and the stone granary stacks up to form the home of the fire god. Bewildered by the sight, I bow down before the hallowed grounds, approaching the sacred hall through the path of pine and cypress. The red columns and painted walls shine brightly, filled with images of ghosts and creatures in shades of green and red. I offer wine and food to show my devotion, as the temple elder guides me in my actions. He holds the divination plates, stating that this is the most auspicious, unlike any other. Surviving in the wilderness, I am content with my modest livelihood. The lords and nobles have long been absent, and even the gods find it hard to bestow blessings. Night falls, and I seek refuge in the high tower of a Buddhist temple, surrounded by the stars and moon, and the misty morning light. Monkeys cry, bells ring, and the sun rises, bringing a new day."
