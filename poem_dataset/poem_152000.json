Its green canopy and feather flag flutter, riding on the vibrant wind, it wriggles and moves about. When the dragon leaves, let's go slowly; the rain flies once and again. I live in a house, I am hungry for grain; I long for the other states' withered fruits, without the dragon, where can I rely on? In the east and west lanes, we sing and play; by the lake on the right, the sea on the left, the forest hut cave coils with verdant mist. The jade feast, the pearl palace, the cloud orchestra, and the jade concubine. Establish the dragon's residence without shame, when the task is completed, the dragon will return. Bid farewell to the dragon with words; the creek is full of water plants and ferns, when will I return to send me off?"

We think of those who are working in the heat, and cannot run away from empty thoughts. Quietly surpassing the hearts of the past, repeatedly emptying ourselves, making us calm. I carry my sins, and close the door to my guilt. My friends and I help each other, going back and forth between existence and nonexistence.

How can we know that smelting gold and stone can gain Qi's fine machinery? The elk's antlers are just untied, and the kiwi's fan is never stopped. All treasures become southern dialect, and one pillow is safe in the north door. The palace gates are installed with residual fragrance, and the thatched cottage is widely enhanced. In this bustling century, only 70 people are rare. I express my feelings by flowing, and I wash my clothes vigorously. The thunderstorm gives birth to coolness, and the heavenly grace feels it. Poetry comes to achieve quiet victory, and the sentence arrives without deceiving me. Put on your formal clothes and think about your guest position, and put on your heavy armor and think about the frontier. During the hot weather, you feel like autumn, but don't be sad when autumn arrives."

The young seedlings are full of new life, and the transformed leaves shine brightly. The sky is not selfish, as abundant harvests were rare in ancient times. In old age, I rely on incense and candles, and at dawn I prepare my clothes solemnly. A thousand bows bend my body, countless feelings engrave my muscles.

I muse, drinking heavily, forgetting my balance. This is due to an illness during this time, and I feel frail. As I start my journey, many floating clouds surround me, yet I still wish to breathe deeply. I miss the quiet evenings, and I send my thoughts through beautiful words.

    "translate": "As the forest hills are shaken and withered, plants and trees show their jagged branches. Things should return to their roots, and people should think of retreating. I am fortunate to be at leisure now, with my daily efforts quickly passing. Closing the door, I think of my few mistakes; going out, I forget my creations. I only know that the turtle hides in six places, much like the frog in a well. A fine guest comes to my door, bringing good words and a fur-trimmed cape. Suddenly, the vinegar jar is overturned, like escaping from a lonely pit. Seeing the path requires a new blade, guiding the keyhole is unclear. Yuanfang is skilled in his work, turning the monastery and mutual warnings. We sing and respond with five characters, enjoying the taste and eliminating a hundred ailments. Sharing simple meals together, we face the quiet surroundings. As the frost wind increases hatred, we regret not traveling through sugarcane fields. When will we climb the mountains and hills, forgetting the boundaries? The river and lake offer a grand view, the umbrella hat reaches the summit."

The mystical cave is vast and boundless, its legend depicted in pictures. Although geographically located in the eastern ocean, its reputation has been passed down through the ages. Today, we still appreciate its poetry and lament its past journeys. I, a drifting soul, have settled down here, buying a neighbor's home for temporary residence. The rivers and mountains reveal their beauty, as do the plants and trees that I have planted. By digging into the rocks, I find a sweet-smelling spring; by opening up the windows, I can see the lush green mountains. Wonderful guests enter my courtyard, bringing with them a refreshing energy. Fragrant flowers bloom at the base of the stones, while beautiful birds sing from the seats. Holding a staff, I climb the west side of the mountain; navigating a boat, I travel north along the river. The bright moon floats effortlessly, while sparse stars dangle delicately. As the morning sky clears, the rising sun casts a warm hue. The misty mountains sparkle with purple and green, while distant sights dazzle with red and blue. The shadows of the twin towers stand tall, as the ancient palace roof juts out sharply. The vast oceans and bays are captivating, while the boundaries of heaven and earth seem narrow. Former sages may be gone, but their fascinating experiences live on. During this time of harmony, our friends gather together to share excitement. Would they kindly stay for a while? This avoids the separation caused by the city walls. Our long songs echo through the forests, while our witty words come from the stones. We forget our forms and embrace freedom, avoiding excessive restraint. Do not be startled, for I ask you today what night it is. Can short walls made by Cao and Liu compare to the shoulders of the hills? Laughing at the gathering in the Mountains of the Passes, we mourn the past traces of those from yesteryear. Who can truly understand their actions? Who has lost their horses correctly? When your new poems arrive, do not fear the pressure of difficult rhymes. Return when you're ready, as your enthusiasm remains accumulated. Thank you for sharing your precious gems, as you write the thoughts within my heart."

I have yet to write a poem about a night boat ride, promising myself to stay here often. I hear the sound of knocking and calling, ready to leave at any moment. Reading your poems three times cleanses my sorrow of a thousand measures. Every step is meaningful, every place worthy of admiration. The mountain light truly awakens me, after the rain it seems freshly bathed. In the deep recesses of the monastery, bamboo shelters green and tall. The sound of chess and the wind blend together, creating a rhythm all its own. Sleeping feels sweet, soft speech has a fragrance. The old monk and his guests are forgotten, carefully reading the Lotus Sutra. Standing briefly in the clean water, a long embankment full of good intentions. The boat awakens early, the paddler listens for the return. The warm breeze disperses the golden waves, the heart and mind both lonely in their sorrow. There are wonderful lines within, timeless and without attachment. The poet writes high, as in the past, as in the present, like an ancient sage. Returning home to refine one's work, sending it off to the woods and valleys. The bed is just taken down, our friendship remains strong. Not forgetting the students of old, sharing the same high path as Wang and Yang. Laughing at Lu's jokes, it's enough to entertain the scrolls. Zhi is even more endearing, eating vegetables as if they were meat. I, however, am humbled by Zhang's appearance, feeling like a pearl or jade. Dare I avoid the clear eyes, barely escaping the red wheel? In the morning, in the soft redness, a clear and pleasant dream should continue. Not lamenting the final delay, the lake and mountains have already been collected."

Xie's poems are grand and ancient, while Zhao's lines are crisp, subtle, and bitter. After studying hard, I have become an expert in my own right, but I do not know whom I have served. Separated by great distances, I long for you, imagining our love to be as cold as ice. Skillfully carving square and round, the veteran craftsman follows the rules, with his work perfectly aligned.

It bothers me that nature takes care of me, making my deep thoughts distant and vast. Looking back at my children crying from hunger, I imagine that farmers should be happy."

In my spare time, I only float on Hui Chang Lake. As I grow older, I climb to the top of the magnificent canopy, facing the straight lotus peak furnace. The long river embraces like a jade encirclement, with the bright moon shining like a pearl. The Nanchi River and its tributaries flow out, and the early and late tides at the Campbell River are present. The empty writing brush hangs brightly, and the rising golden sun watches the bathing crows. The shellfish in the port do not seem charming, and the snails floating in the water seem to be suspended in nothingness. How can I have such a magnificent river and mountain? It seems that the divine support of the fortune-teller is there. Realizing that there is no need to make any improvements, how can there be two mistakes? When meeting an old friend, we laugh at each other's misunderstandings, and our lives do not understand the benefits of riches and luxuries. Let us associate with the villagers, avoiding previous titles and addresses. We have not yet become lost in the mountains, and we are still ashamed of our country. Cutting bamboo makes a path for three benefits, and fishing becomes a tired picture of a small boat. It is known that the ultimate boundary is truly wonderful, and the lonely island is not really lonely. Leaning on the railing, I want to enjoy the view, and the sail is just coming. Tomorrow's enthusiasm will surely not be shallow, but I fear the fatigue of the shoulder carriage husband."

Day after day, one remains loyal to their ignorance, not realizing the potential like a stone. Yesterday, Tao Creek was named Chong Zhai, wishing to record ancient poetry. This morning, suddenly, the hermitage was transformed, its name and poetry sharing the same birthdate. Chong Zhai studied hard from an early age, later discarding academic pursuits. Frost sets, knowing when water recedes; spiritual pursuits bring benefits. Once understanding the teacher's words about elevation and humility, one becomes fully immersed in understanding the whole. Outside the study, composing and reciting poems, there is no need for embellishment. Recalling past conversations with respected teachers, one wonders what they have gained.

In the early morning, the refreshing fragrance lasts all night. We understand that the lotuses emerge naturally without embellishment, and they seem to be painted by flowing water. The setting sun adds charm to the red lotuses, competing for beauty among the clear waters. Among them, who is the most satisfied? A few literary birds are not allowed to be alone. Golden carp leap like sewing needles in the stream, and the rain canopy melts like poured white wine. Our friends raise their cups and break their vows, passing down the drinking game and flower-passing order, not vulgar drawings. Crossing the Kunming Lake truly feels like a silk journey, and Mount Taibai seems to be a ship on the divine register. Tomorrow, we will surely create new poems, and today, we proudly have a poet as our leader. Suddenly, the poem evokes thoughts of West Lake, and we feel as if we are separated from Penglai. Remembering our boat rides and nighttime adventures, we listened to the lotus songs and picked the dewdrops. The south and north are high, and the long and short bridges frequently float. Returning to my post at the Divine Warrior, I should return, and you should leave your duties. Present your plans and achieve success, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor. Looking back at the Bamboo Pavilion, it's just an indentation, and there's no need for fishermen to compete for seats. Red and green lotuses entertain each other, and the bright moonlight becomes waves of gain. During the hot summer, we enjoy the cool breeze three times, and it truly dissolves our hearts' traces in the Twin Clears."

Soon after the rain passes, the wind stops, only the water fragrance floats on the night of the moon. The water reaches the scattered bays of the flying clouds, where can the red clouds hide in the forests and wetlands? Children ask what is there at the crossing, reeds and weeds cover the muddy green. Open the sky like a mirror, let the fishing boat float alone. I am old and ashamed to be bothered by the number of mixed things, supplying drunken white with lotus plants outside bamboo. When guests come, they sit in the night, the environment becomes more noisy with their presence. Clear threads and muddy feet follow each other, it's easy to divide the wide water and narrow land. Turn the pavilion, I used to be a poet ally, together we sing and cheer each other. As soon as I get a line, I recite loudly; the reply comes, but not far away. I realize that heaven also supports our divine conversation, making the night singing of lotus songs last longer. It's nice to be in a place where you fit in, without the fire in the world. Although I love reciting, I don't have good lines; I enjoy being idle. I can't control the crab and conch, how can I help the buzzing frog in official and private affairs? Suddenly, the natural sound of the universe sounds like cicadas, all works are silent, pushing the giant breaker. I vaguely think of the fragrant hundred miles of the South Pond, planning to set sail with a single sheet in the area. I appreciate the poem even more when I eat and pick the pearls from the tender lotus seeds. It's better to guard the Bamboo Villa and retreat when the water disappears and the frost dies."

    "poem": "桃李枝頭鎖沍寒，天工一笑發嫣然。\n喚回雪苑陽春脚，幻出瓊壺小有天。\n欻看南圖羊角上，恍思西抹阿婆年。\n政須點勘頻呵護，準擬開函近御筵。",
    "translate": "Branch of peach and apricot trees lock in the cold, a smile from Heaven creates a blooming scene. Bring back the spring warmth to the Snow Garden, create a small world in the jade vase. Suddenly, on the southward journey, one thinks of the west and the old woman's years. It is necessary to check frequently and care for it, preparing to open the letter near the imperial banquet."

    "translate": "Without heating my hands to roll up the curtain, Zhuan Emperor governs the cold, releasing strictness. The official plum trees have been released to entertain Du Fu, and the garden willows remind us of Tao Qian. There is no need to evaluate and pursue Wang and Xie, distinguishing beauty from ugliness. Feeling ashamed for all the empty meals, why should we be pleased with our own accomplishments?"

    "translate": "For a moment, the heavenly palace names are recorded; for three years, the literary and customs of Wen Wen are modeled. The emperor is dressed in imperial robes to encourage the ride; more banquet banquets are held to discuss the scriptures. The path in the apricot garden follows the warm spring wind; the star river's boat connects with the eight spirit energy. If the holy strategy asks an old man with yellow hair, speak lightly or heavily, it concerns the court."

    "translate": "The world's boundaries are vast, and the longevity domain spans thousands of years. The advice is carried out with the wisdom of Tuowu River, and the lectures encourage the origin of Nong's Hall. Together, we celebrate the fish in the depths, eagerly awaiting the dawn of the phoenix. Under the eaves, the fine rain sprinkles like a golden bell, predicting a joyful yellow rain."

    "translate": "The fleeting years leave me behind, who dares to defy the course of time? I feel ashamed for my newfound connection with Yuan Chen, yet I cherish my old knowledge of Bo Yu. Together we ride through the night, lit by the fiery torch, playing games and laughing until the wee hours. No longer are we young and bold, but we still find joy in poetry and its escape from reality."

We do not see the mockery of the Immortal Mu, only the mad ramblings of the Elder Hao. Our two hearts have no one to share them; countless flowers fall busily. Tell the east wind to be the master, don't let the foolish white envy the tender yellow."

    "translate": "Do not tire of the oriole's repeated songs, the poet also chirps out his grievances. In middle age, with sorrow and separation in their hearts, they cherish the time to gather with friends and relatives. Treading on fallen flowers, their silk socks are worn; reciting poetry, their words are adorned with red. Leaning on the railing, they sigh three times in vain; the setting sun after the rain cannot be captured."

    "translate": "Drunkenness is my hometown during leisure time, a narrow boat on the cold food day is so vast and boundless. It's a pity that the rain has passed, with the sea buckthorn in full bloom; yet I still pity the pink butterflies accompanying awakening madness. After the tourists have quieted down, the West Hill is so beautiful; as spring approaches, the old garden is busy with activities. Frequent letters may not be necessary for the busy official; during the flower season, it is still a shame to miss the golden peach blossoms."

Watching the clouds from beneath Incense Burner Peak, peering into the reflection in the jade vase. The subtle meaning of 5,000 verses returns to daily use, seeing the master through 100,000 compiled words. The old friend's banner rises, escaping the hatred of the fleeing scholar, not worth seeking at night when the green stalk is visited."

    "translate": "Spring has passed splendidly for over a week, and the subtle flowers still retain their spring essence. I reflect on how the Creator has been kindle with affection for me, providing a home in the mountains late in life to shelter my body. When guests arrive, our emotions are close and we only speak of the past; when poems are completed, the meaning is sufficient and there is no need for novelty. In the long journey of life, we often become distant from each other; it is fortunate that you have visited me, as it is essential for us to meet frequently."

Wishing for your guidance in poetry, I am ashamed that my verses do not meet your expectations.

In the small garden, the scenery provides solace; when can we share our poetry again?"

He has long resided in Yangzhou, where his poetry is rich and colorful, and now temporarily returns to an isolated island, where his verses are refreshing.

Occasionally suffering from indigestion from eating fish, he should not let his wine go to waste."
