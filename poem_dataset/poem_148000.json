The cherry blossoms are adorned with silk, their laughter only suitable for revealing a rosy cheek."

Indeed, the six immortals were summoned by imperial decree, their scrolls and books floating on the Tungtze River. The dark secrets are revealed before the emperor's scrutiny, the light gradually fading into the depths of the underworld. Next year, they will surely meet in the White Tiger Hall, reciting the Great Learning and the Doctrines of the Mean."

Recalling the early days of the revival, the evil minions fell from their hats and gowns. At that time, you led the charge for justice, since then supporting the three cardinal principles. Your loyalty shines through the heavens, your solitary anger reaches the sky. The elite army of 200,000 marched ahead without delay. They conquered the west to stabilize Liang and Yi, and soothed the south with their journey along the Yangtze River. The soldiers' hearts were already attached, and the nation's might was displayed. The white garments were used to mourn the new palace, the sorrowful cries reverberated throughout the land. The cunning enemy trembled at the news, their plans were thwarted for a long time. The exchange of gifts and trade flourished, the soldiers and horses hid in wait. Your plans were not implemented, you had to surrender to the south. You returned with white hair, but a red heart. Hoping to be recognized, you worked diligently. Destiny could not be predicted, human affairs also changed. You gracefully retired, riding a dragon in the white cloud realm. Let this empty mountain become famous alongside the sun and moon. For a thousand years, the military camp stands strong, watchfully facing each other. In the next year, I will come, the fierce wind will shake the high mountains. I will pay my respects by kneeling nine times, my chest heaving with tears. The mountains have crumbled for several years, the determined spirits have grown more sad. Central China still reeks of blood and soil, humans have become like wolves and dogs. There is no end to your return, your successor shines brightly. I sincerely pray for the prosperity of the Song Dynasty, forever stretching without bounds."

The diligent Lord walks on his jade feet, sending me to ascend the southern mountain. The southern mountain is not extremely high, but the snow is deep and the road is long. Mud walking for several journeys, tonight staying at Oak Island. Tomorrow we will part ways, sadly unable to stay. Reciting your poem for me, three sighs increase our intimacy. I do not dare to forget your kindness, I will sing for you."

I come to appreciate this beautiful name, building a small dwelling in the deep ravine. Always remembering those who lived a thousand years ago, their loyal hearts extend beyond yesterday and today. The heroic spirit is depicted vividly, as cold as the original nine creations. Fragrant water plants are offered, and clear springs provide the wine. You come to understand this meaning, but your steps are heavy and unhappy. Kneeling, you recite a long poem, offering your spirit to the vast emptiness."

Hearing that you travel a thousand miles, your four horses gallop forward. I feel the heavy sadness of parting, as the sky grows darker. Your journey must be tiring, and the people's suffering is deepening. Throughout the land, taxes are urgently collected, and yearly invasions continue. May your journey bring relief to the people, fulfilling my heart's desire. I will share my books and wine with you, just as we once did. I think of my family, who are like a harmonious ensemble. We cannot journey together now, as the trees stand bare and cold. I am glad for my nephews, who are respectful and well-behaved. Tomorrow, I will remember you, gazing at the mountains of the Chu state."

In his youth, he excelled in calligraphy and literature; his achievements were undeniable. Standing tall and unique, with a radiant and icy beauty, he took a long stride and the music of the heavenly birds flew through the autumn sky. His high-pitched tone was hard to hear for those who sought it; as he grew older, he found no one to share his passion. One day, he left the dusty world behind, riding the brisk wind. He turned to call out to Anqi and extended his hand to invite Han Zhong. Throughout eternity, his spirit lingers, leaving no trace behind. His lifelong friends are now gone, but their memories live on in his tears and inscriptions in the secluded palace. This person cannot be seen, but his intellectual spirit lives on through the mysteries of literature."
