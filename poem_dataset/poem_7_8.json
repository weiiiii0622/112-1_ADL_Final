The strings are reversed and picked, like a stream of electricity, and the spring thunder strikes the autumn hawk directly. The Han empress only has proper names, while the Qin girl vainly boasts of having fairy bones. I heard ten years ago during the Tianbao era, when Liangzhou was not yet a lair of the Western Barbarians. The Han people in linen clothes and right collars are all Han people, not realizing that the dust of the barbarians would temporarily flourish. At the end of peace, the crazy Hu barbarians chaos, dogs and pigs tumble about at will. When Emperor Xuanzong did not reach Wanliqiao, the eastern and western capitals of Luoyang and Dongding disappeared at the same time. The Han people were taken as captives, and they were empty woe, swallowing their anger and tears. Sometimes, looking at the Han moon and the Han sky, the resentment gas forms a comet. In the west and west of the country's gates, the high city and deep ramparts are closed to idle soldiers. The rivers and lakes are within inches, and cannot be collected. Pulling grain and pushing cars is in vain. Today, I hear the cool song of Liangzhou, which makes my mind and spirit faintly leap. If the winning child plays on the frontier, the soldiers' tears and blood should be dried."

    "translate": "This mountain represents the eastern region, its fame visible from far and near. It blends with the vast ocean, connected to the vast and pristine heavens. I arrive wondering if summer has just begun, as the secluded path is free of heat. Clear water flows out of the creek, and the vines cover the wind gently. The climate changes dramatically in height and depth, with the sky becoming clear in the evening. The smoke and rain nourish the valley, while the clouds and sunlight illuminate the cliffs. The universe is nurturing all life, with plants and trees thriving beautifully. Grass and trees have attractive colors, while young deer make new sounds. Climbing the rocks, one can enjoy the sweet essence of the cinnamon tree; in the caves, one can find jade-like treasures. This hidden path leads to immortality, but who will attain it? My heart yearns for the herbs and elixirs, wishing to reside in the mystical realm. I sigh at the journey of official life, regretting not being true to my loyalty and filial piety. I lack the wisdom to practice distant arts, and I feel ashamed of my hidden virtues. How can I leave this place and ascend to the heavenly capital?"

As the settlements gradually move farther away, one begins to enjoy the views more. The distant mountains meet each other, and the connected ponds turn around.

The momentum carries them farther, and their hearts are at ease. As the moon rises over the estuary, its bright light shines on the eastern gate.

Drunkenly, I compose and recite poetry, my brushstroke reflecting the rosy light. Qin Ye leans on the railing in the evening, her soft branches falling on her blue robe. The attentive and calm green pool waters serve as a mirror for you to apply makeup."

I enjoy leisurely reciting poetry while enjoying the simplicity of tea, breaking the smooth surface towards the nearby veranda."

The stone root dawn mist is green, and the curtain edge sunset glow is fresh. The willow path is difficult to promise, and the court grass is good for drunken sleep. The clear and bright weather is different, and the creation of nature seems biased. Not just suitable for beautiful scenery, but also necessary to see in summer. The medicine seedlings are abundant like knots, and the vine tendrils are tightly woven. Pear-like fruit hangs from the branches, and well-cleansed well water is drawn from the well. The cicada shells fall on the pink wall, and the young sparrows stumble on the red fence. The heat vapor faintly perceives, and the clear breeze wears through it. The mountain peak rises, and the sunflower leaf does not need a fan. Seeing the beautiful autumn again, hanging in summer. Red leaves on frost-covered trees, fragrant old beds by the pond. Who spread the lotus seeds? The moss and moss learn how to make money. The insect sounds at the brick paving stones, and the bright moon shines on the curtain. New chrysanthemums grow on the small steps, and evening cicadas buzz in the high veranda. The rain sound is chill, and the geese shadow is morning linked. How can I enjoy this? It's even more pitiful in deep winter. Looking out the window, seeing the short scene, and seeing the heavy rivers inside the trees. Clear hills and mountains emerge, and the atmosphere of the pines and cypresses is complete. Singing the white snow song, reciting the early plum essay. Who understands the origin? The original governor is talented. Sometimes stay under the black umbrella, gather all day around the luxurious banquet. Who sings about the suffering of the people? Crazy travel in mud and strings. Mixed with jade food, the gold boat rushes in and out. Serving as an extraordinary guest, making jokes like the immortal. The flag flutters brilliantly, and the seductive dancer dances gracefully. After the banquet, my heart still yearns, and I am excited about going home. Should only worry about the approaching night, and not tired of appreciating the whole year. I, a humble and humble person, am lucky to be able to climb and have the opportunity to circle. I widen my eyebrows in surprise, and I slowly walk happily. Although I know the pain of recitation, I strive for the ultimate mystery without extreme. I casually write forty rhymes, willing to be blamed for not being carefully specialized."

    "translate": "In the world, there are red bananas, transplanted from afar. With difficulty leaving the malarial land, gracefully entering the red door. Leaves compete in the tone of the blue sky, flowers wither away with the traces of dew. Many in Chang'an remain unknown, who would have thought to stir up the soul of poetry."

    "translate": "The divine escape shows the beauty of the land, and the transformation into a thundering god. The splitting of the Han River is mended by the creation of the goddess, and the peak's sword leaps high. Now that the new duties have been established, when will talents not be left behind? If it's the path of fame, one must acknowledge the potential for disaster."

    "translate": "The chicken struts on the peach branch, the autumn sky hides a little bit of slightness. The broad clouds and red clouds shine together, the high sun and moon compete in brilliance. If you open the way of heaven, you will start the emperor's machine at the same time. In terms of current affairs, you leisurely open the purple palace door."

    "translate": "In the poor alley, I suspect my original surname is Yan; late at night, I stroll out of the woods. Several long flutes play as the sun sets; a piece of remaining cloud breaks through the mountains. The island temple gently strikes its stone bell; the fisherman's house is half-closed with a wooden door. I linger here, searching for poems for a long time; I wait for the moon to rise over the creek."

    "translate": "Gently riding across the east river, now I hate endless. A pinch of autumn smoke on the bank, a semicircle of the setting sun on the ridge. The taste of the road is still the same, but the sound of hometown is gradually different. Holding my thoughts, I watch the Liang Garden, where the painted tower and silk strings echo through the distance."

Different from the gardens in heaven, this spring arrives first at the sun's side. The color is light and slightly moistened by dew; the threads are delicate without being touched by dust. Just as I was about to break off a branch, I return home in time for this morning."

    "translate": "The source of the river is swift like an arrow, and the turn to the north makes our eyes dizzy. In the middle of the ten miles, the water is clear and vast, as if the dragons and snakes are there but invisible. The old farmer and gardener look to the sky and speak, asking the god of the reservoir to bring rain. At dawn, I dress in formal attire and offer a sacrifice, with rich wine and offerings presented with sincerity. The female witches dance below the hall, their appearance seems to give and accept, like the wind and clouds that rise in the mountains and forests. The atmosphere shrouds the temple and its surroundings, and the morning sun no longer shines on the green peaks. Returning to the mouth of the creek, I row along the clear stream, with the favorable wind and rain bringing me to the city. The officials stand under the rain, delighted and paying respect, as if offering and receiving to the gods. On the city walls and high buildings, I gaze into the misty distance, not knowing how many thousands of miles away, wishing for the blessing to be shared with them. I speak my words, not slowly, and return with my carriage and horses, maintaining the same courtesy. The high walls and large gates enhance the divine residence, making it more magnificent. Those who pass by the temple should show greater respect, providing them with abundant wine, food, and wealth. O gods, o spirits, o gods, o spirits, do not treat the offerings with disrespect, but enjoy them with sincerity."

    "translate": "Mt. Tianshan veils the spiritual cave, deep and mysterious to ponder. A pair of white bats fly towards the light three times. Although they have two wings, they have no feathers. If they didn't eat stone marrow, how could they soar in the sky? Occasionally seeing them return is worth talking about, but it's even better not to see them return."
