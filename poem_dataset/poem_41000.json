Above, there is the government platform, looking out over the city from eight directions. The mountains are cramped with dragons and tiger spirits, while the waters are darkened by the apparitions of the chimaera. A white rainbow seems to devour people, while red steeds gallop side by side. The painted beams are adorned with golden and green decorations, while the stone paths wind through the barren lands. Monkeys cry as they hang upside down during the moonlit night, while cranes contemplate the heavens. Fountains are dug to house the dragon and snake spirits, while pine trees are planted to shelter the beautiful birds. Bats teach their young in the crevices of the roof, while snakes dangle their shells. Gardening is like nurturing virtuous people, removing weeds is like getting rid of evil. As the sun sets, the city gates echo with drums, while the wind carries the sound of the temple bells. Dust is swept away, and the grass cut back. Peaches with their leaves still attached are plucked, and green plums are eaten with one's clothes. Bamboo remains constant in its beauty, while willow branches sway before falling. Dust flies around the Jingyang well, and the grass covers the Linchun pavilion. The lotus flowers are like beauties, turning their heads playfully. In the open space stands a straight path, yet no one dares to pause. Mice scurry at midnight, while ghosts knock and peck at the darkening sky. The lonely pine tree is difficult to stand, and the ugly rocks are hard to place. The woodpecker diligently removes insects, ensuring the health of the trees. The evening breeze blows through the wilting tung tree, making it rustle. The imposing Jiangling stone rises high, with only a thin layer of moss covering it. No talk of prosperity and decline, just raising one's head to contemplate the vast expanse. Alas, I have not yet arrived here, my limitations akin to that of a centipede. The crane in the cage longs for the duck feathers, while the fierce tiger cherishes the hornworm's lair. One day, an exemplary governor came to observe the bagpipe. He would often speak to himself, responding to the words of the Heavenly Emperor. Sometimes the wind and clouds do not come, leaving the world at a loss for something to do. I desire to cook a long whale, using the four seas as my cauldron. I wish to capture the mighty penguin, using the heavens and earth as my fishing line. How can I gain the ability to fly, soaring majestically into the vastness?"

The border winds began to blow last night, leaving it to mourn and grieve alone. Unable to match the sparrows on the wall, they fly together around the twin towers."

As I grow older, I realize how precious springtime is; I enjoy myself, fearing that guests may be hard to keep. The rain hastens the grass to grow, and the sun allows flowers to bloom freely. Do not be tired of our drinking bouts, lest idle concerns lead to idle sorrows."

    "translate": "As the evening approaches, the wanderer's books and sword remain untidy. The eagles are captured in the clear autumn, waiting to soar. Traveling through the Tu Mountain range, we revere and love as if ascending a dragon. Reviewing history, we sense the divine king's spirit, as the world seems empty and free. What else is there in the east and south but to indulge in the ancient kings' wind? In the past, Emperor Feitian ruled, creating a great flood of darkness. The imperial map transformed into fish and turtles, with the natural order swept away. The emperor commanded the use of boats and oars, gathering the essence of culture and knowledge. Displaying the strength of the nine provinces, various paths led back to the east. The old things regained their brightness, as the vast furnace was again melted. The door of the scriptures was not biased, clearly showing the public nature of the world. Liang said that he was born at the same time as Tang and Yu, who passed the throne to each other like flowers and insects. This mountain faces all nations, with a single poem shared across the vast sea. For ten years, the world has been unified, with every hair on the autumn caterpillar representing the emperor's work. The emperor wears the robe without pride, not deaf to the wickedness of Jiwo. Holding his hair, he shows respect for the wise; repairing the thatched cottage, he sees the humble palace. The common people find it hard to deal with appearances, while the divine and holy cannot be respectful. The Dao is hidden for three thousand years, spreading its remnants through the music and drums. At the place where the scepter was held, the positive energy still flourishes. The sea islands are like clear temples, with the heavenly and human beings offering sacrifices abundantly. The profound grace extends to the plants and trees, while the red prophecy is named after Kongtong. The grass-roots officials of different generations have no way to achieve their achievements. I have never met the steps of Yao, who could believe in my loyalty in my lifetime. I regret not being able to attend the meeting, preparing to be a whip boy. Singing and leaving the mountains, I carry the heart of virtue and morality forever."

A man in a prosperous time, is it not to linger in the mud. What is a wooden puppet, who waits on the golden peacock. Depressed by poverty and lowliness, time seems endless.

Eventually, as if in love, the thief becomes an enemy. The coast is bright, the nine gates are more serene. Tall and urging the golden cup, the cow breathes all night long. The barbaric customs are lightly thrown away, the north mountain yearns for today's journey. The wild goose's voice comes from hometown, the traveler's tears fall on the southern land. My lifelong aspiration for the mist and clouds, reading books to seek a seal of office. The four seas are still bare, how can there be no shame in hometown? The setbacks of life are nothing to sigh about, strong like a water dragon. The fragrant orchid waves in the valley, the seagull soars on the wave.

Facing the moon and embracing the long sword, my sorrowful chest is in disarray. The busy streets are calm like water, why do I wander through the mountains? I have no time to eat a meal, and the eagle's plan is truly leisurely. Shantao teases his wife, and I am not tired of Penglai. Tomorrow I will ride the horse again, and my thoughts as a guest will be restless."

By refining stones, we heal the original energy, and by slaying the giant turtle, we correct the order of nature.

The purple clay searches for the sea and the mountains, and the grand pen enriches the rock corridors.

The hens' hatred is deep, and the mad dogs are helping each other. The prayers for the three spirits anger, and Huan Tian's nine generations perish. The whales are soon caught in the net, and the demons are soon abandoned in the wilderness. The pines and cypresses become greener in the frost, and the magnolias and orchids smell stronger. The sage's plans flow through generations, and the fairy lineage originates from the immortals. The island and peninsula taxes are light, and the ripples float through the cool rice paddies. Ducks, fish, and clothing are enough for the lotus and osmanthus. I dream of the Garden of Hua Xi, and play in the Taoist realm. Hawks and falcons fly together, and loyalty and filial piety reside side by side. There is an old man who can tune the dumplings, and no one knows about the hidden fishhook. The universe provides insight and capacity, and the sea and river enter the articles. The wild crane misses the palace, and the mountain deer remembers the temple hall. The sand and mud are empty, and the stars rise and fall several times. Why should the historical grass be seen? Can the ceremonial wine jar be forgotten for a moment? Finally, it follows the \"Ode to the Orange Tree,\" and pays homage to the heavenly emperor."

I gradually realize that I am a hindrance, fortunate to be honored by empty minds. Today, we are reunited, our hearts rising above the depths."

The hidden prompt makes the lotus bloom beautifully, and the sudden urging makes the cicadas begin to sing. Rain falls, reducing the heat, and bamboo leads cold smoke to emerge. The soldier longs for home, and the traveler is afraid of the long journey. Before the wild geese arrive, you can gradually hear the night's pestle sound. Zhang Han thinks of the fish delight, and Ban Jiao sings of the fan love. Echoes and dust are hard to ask, and the cricket's steps and the moonlight are empty."

Who is dreaming of the sparse tent? Alone, you wander the desolate path less often. It suits the scenery of the river and lake, allowing gulls and herons to fly. Most lovingly, where prosperity reigns, the rice plants in the southern fields are fertile."

    "translate": "The green moss and vines cover the three paths, who will come to the secluded alley in a carriage and horse? Laying down the books and music, I abandon my work; laughing and welcoming the wind and moon with leisure. In autumn, I often thank the cricket for its clear sound; as I grow older, I am ashamed to borrow wine to enhance my appearance. Unable to help others in their time of need, I dare to love the green mountains in the bright morning light."

Alas, I bitterly regret the lack of time spent with my close friends; we don't know when we'll be able to enjoy each other's company again."
