With timely planting, the seedlings turn green and alive, making us feel the fragrance of the autumn wind in the rice grains."

Leaving behind all worldly concerns, we lay on the pine pillow outside, letting our names and identities drift away in the rivers and lakes."

Raising my eyes, all feelings gather; The autumn wind, the grains are scattered. How much is left of human life? Spider webs form dreams and illusions. Some sell themselves for cooking; Deception is like yoke and shift. Others engage in verbal warfare; Strategies are as intricate as those of Qin. Some pursue openness and understanding; Transforming their forms to admire Anqi. Others escape emptiness and seek enlightenment; Their hearts follow the path of a Buddhist monk. Not to say that ancient sages and worthies Have a foundation laid by heaven itself. For oneself, not for others; Accumulating knowledge is like amassing wealth. Do not waste a single day; Perhaps hundreds of aspirations will flourish. As education dissipates over time, Those with insight retreat like a retreat. Read the teachings and symbols; Morality is not governed by rules. What is noble or lowly? It is just wasted words. Advance your learning to understand; Poetry and the interpretation of the Tao. Endure poverty to know destiny; Let your family suffer hunger and cold. Pursue your art and craft; You want to be a public official. Do not forget the path to fame; Through thorns and brambles, step by step. The towering mountains and stars watch; Discussing as if they were lowly. My teacher, Confucius; And his disciples, such as Yan Hui and Zengzi. Even Mencius; The Four Books shine like a divination instrument. Your family has two brilliant descendants; Pearls and jades shine with the light of the Liang Dynasty. Yuanfang knows self-reliance; Gradually exploring the mysteries within. They learn language and conversation; They have a tendency to learn during their journey. Time flies like lightning; Sages and madmen are in danger. Filial piety is the essence of a hundred actions; Breathing deeply and smiling cheerfully. Examine the heavens and the earth; Begin from the tip of the eyebrows. Speak kindly about righteousness; Remove makeup and cosmetics from the times. Encourage yourself and encourage yourself; Do not let old age bring sadness. Use it as a warning; Show it to my children."

The chrysanthemums are still fragrant, and the autumn migratory birds pass by year after year. I miss my loved ones, and time flows like a river. With this temporary life, I am ashamed of myself in the world. It's better to be exposed to the sun first and waste time for nothing. What are my children doing? They are growing potatoes, chestnuts, cabbage, and kale. They will use these to make wine for me as the pine trees stand tall at the end of the year. I don't agree with this, and I sigh three times in disappointment. They surround me and refuse to leave, laughing and making jokes. Tao Qian and Du Fu, both of whom lived during difficult times, were also able to find joy in their lives. Although the world is narrow, destiny often favors those who are strong. This simple food and water is enough, not like the five-dish meal that is difficult to obtain. In this way, we can enjoy the company of our parents through poetry and etiquette. I respectfully ask you to accept my wishes and share in the happiness of our family. I work hard to express my feelings and listen carefully to your words. I drink too much and become drunk, taking up the pen like a madman. The general outline is shown, and the paper is full without realizing it. Call your children to sing for me, not to be passed on to the awake."

Manqing drinks all day on the tower, sitting upright, regarded as a divine being. The words of the two geniuses have lasted for three hundred years, and Lei Mountain also has its own beauty. When invited, there is no one like to refuse, absorbing the air in the wine jar like the sea. In the night, he drinks without getting drunk, and returns to his path unwillingly. He presses through thorns and lies down on the frost-covered grass, with his cap backwards and his clothes scattered. I came to ask why you are like this, and you smiled and answered fluently. Is it for us? You don't know the fun yet. What day is it today? The universe is tight, like a beehive. I can't show my achievements forward or retire to the hills by the riverside. At that time, I saw the moon in the sky, and I vaguely met the drunken Li at the stone river. Sometimes I turn around and see the neighbor's roof, just like the neighbor's room next door. Considering appearance, I seem to be reckless, but looking beyond appearance shows who I am. The world is always controlled by appearances, but I have a clear heart from the beginning. Under the elderberry vines, I find my original heart. When I heard this, I was shocked, and suddenly woke up from my dreams. From now on, when there is wine, we will search for each other, and let others see us awake in our drunken state."

    "translate": "Before the Danxia mountains, at the top of the kind clouds, two walls gaze at each other with a pale iron coldness. In the spring breeze and the autumn moon, we greet each other, our dishes and tea bowls accompanied by the sound of incense. Sometimes we talk about places where there is no connection, and sometimes we enter meditation as we close our eyes. Originally, monks and laypeople have no connection, but when their tastes match, it is worthy of lasting friendship. In nine years, you have revived countless wastelands; who can stop your desire to leave fiercely? I am already seventy-six years old this year, and my teacher is also fifty-two and often sick. Life's connections are based on karma, and in old age, we part with a heavy sadness. The east lake is wide and vast, with thousands of acres of mist, and the wind and waves stir the shadows of Xi and E. There is an ancient Buddha land on the west mountain, where birds sing and flowers fall, surrounded by clouds and water. While drunk, I ramblingly speak; when sober, how do you both understand?"

It's hard to live a long life, even legends like Hongya and Huqiu are just that. With a stable family and content chickens and dogs, there's no need for immortals. Alas, people don't know when to be satisfied, accumulating wealth bit by bit to buy more land. Who can predict the wisdom of their descendants, let alone protect themselves? Raising my head, I ask the sky without answering, taking a deep breath into emptiness. Being together is a blessing, and being at leisure for a while is truly a treasure.

Drinking a hundred cups of new wine, they travel thousands of miles along the Minglu Road, where the fragrance of plum blossoms fills the air. They can write elegantly on jade hall walls, or temporarily stay in the powder pavilion, waiting for their turn. I want to send them off with wine and mutton, wishing them well with a note that forgets worry. They should be prepared for difficult climbs and swift currents, as if they were mounted on steep slopes and steadying their boat in rapid rivers. In the future, they will be honored with star standards, and when they return in victory, they will share their experiences with the Lifting Peak."

Since then, several magistrates have governed the town, and benevolent deeds have been done without exception. Even in the semi-blocked area, turning it into a happy country is not easy.

Establishing a solid foundation requires hard work, and you can endure the slow pace of official positions. Upholding the model of governance, who can govern the town three times like the public? Who can be clean and clear like the public, who can not dazzle by fame? Outstanding as the sun and moon prove, it is sufficient for the journey of the clouds and mist. Leaving the door to serve the people, I will stop for a while, willing to offer my heart to make the drought rain. Is it a rain for three days, is it accidental? One day, it will rain heavily, and heaven has allowed it. I am lucky to have lived for 80 years, and I have witnessed the true predestination. I have no strength to send him far away, nor can I lack words to praise his virtues. Taking the local songs and songs as a gift, I write down the vicissitudes of one in ten thousand.

    "translate": "I met the great Chan master of Changli, who astonished me with his wisdom and solitude. Ouyang enjoyed interacting with Master Weiyan, admiring his literate and scholarly skills. I consider myself far from the level of Han Yu and Ouyang, but I have also visited Buddhist temples. The later generations recognized Master Yea as a wise and respected figure, regarded as the best in the world. He had a vast treasure trove of knowledge within his chest, along with the penmanship of an academician. He dominated the famous mountains, but few knew his true nature. He didn't rely on alms for sustenance, instead competing for space in buildings. Those who pursue fame and fortune are insignificant, while I find inner peace and fulfillment. Each year, my teacher blesses my life, but today I wonder how I can honor his birthday. I want to praise the red cliffs for their height, just as my teacher has a towering peak of flowing milk. I want to celebrate the clear mountains and lakes, just as my teacher has thousands of feet of falling snow, white against the sky. With just a few words, a stream of vines accompanies the incense as it enters the room. My teacher's teachings are empty, and I consider emptiness to be true reality. What is in the world that is not a play? Please, my teacher, laugh and shake the heavens like a painting unfolding."

Steady and stable management, meticulous work is done. The building is magnificent, the bell and drum vibrate, today is full of 100%. It's empty, it's a laugh.

The hunting song and fishing song are like Buddhist chants, the tea agreement and poetry alliance are enough to sing and howl. Bitter and sweet taste in humility, quiet scenery is a treasure.

By the river in front of the temple, the sound of the water flows gently, dry for a while and then surging with waves. Who knows the beauty or ugliness of it all, it's all in the hands of those who come and go. Recalling past days spent with friends, the pain of loss is still felt deeply. The temple is now abandoned, with its walls covered in ivy and its buildings hidden by thorns. When the monk arrives, a sense of sadness fills the air, as he strives to restore what has been lost. After years of hard work, the records are inscribed in large letters, shining for a thousand years. What do those things matter, so despised by everyone? It's as if ants try to move a tree without realizing it, or dogs bark at snow that isn't theirs. There is no defense against me, and there's no need to blame the strange. Why strike the bell and drum, leaving the sacred place behind? As if to say, carrying a bundle on your head is part of my hometown. Once the play clothes are removed, the joy is undeniable, and the bond of unity is difficult to forget. The wind has welcomed and sent me off, and the clouds have accompanied me on my journey. Both presence and absence are indifferent, as soon as I turn around, there's no need to think about it. Life is but a fleeting dream, and the world is but a vast theater. I am already 83 years old without realizing it, and my teacher is also close to a hundred. I am ashamed to return to the stone tower, while my teacher cherishes his humble home in the thatched cottage."

Brilliant people gather below the mountains, exhibiting their talents and skills as skilled artisans. Among them, those who stand out with their unique abilities are the ones who have mastered the art of craftsmanship. Who would have known that creation itself has a purpose, to pass down the legacy of Gongshu, the master craftsman. The ancient temple, once magnificent, suddenly suffers from the harsh winds of change. Renovating it is no easy task, but with determination and focus, it can be achieved. The renovation of the temple in recent years has amazed all who see it, with its grandeur and beauty. The construction continues to grow, with columns standing tall like iron, and roofs shaped like jade. The temple reaches high into the clouds, with rooms large enough to house the Three Great Buddhas and spaces for 500 Arhats on either side. I, with the power of my faith, create a great wave from a small spark. You, with your brilliant ideas, follow my vision, creating a masterpiece that surpasses anything before. As the treasure house stands tall, one cannot help but wonder about the passing of time and the changing fortunes of mankind. Some once-wealthy families now lie in ruins, while others struggle to survive in humble homes. The compassionate and equalizing Dharma is not hindered by worldly affairs, yet there are still biases in society. How can there be countless individuals like you, building magnificent structures everywhere? When there is joy and happiness, without obstacles and temptations, everyone joins in singing the song of craftsmanship together."

In the cold winter, he finds it difficult to support himself. He sees those in wealth and luxury surrounded by their companions, while the poor cannot enter their homes. The old must plan early for cloth, and it is foolish to seek a fur coat in the cold. The remnants of the aristocracy cannot be continued, and the original colors of the cloth are finally hard to forget. Sincerely, I dare not judge lightly.

    "translate": "Four seasons match with four virtues, Yuanyi, Hengyi, and Zhenyi. The first virtue is the most important, which represents the beginning of spring when wood governs life. In summer, fire brings abundant growth, representing the flourishing stage of virtue. In autumn, gold benefits from the harvest, representing the approach to reality. In winter, water symbolizes the completion of things. This cycle never stops. Heaven is high and the earth is low, with yin transforming into yang. The air and its principles are inherently connected, but they have different names for humans. Emotions and rationality are interconnected, and their meaning is clear and precise. The principles of Yuanyi, Hengyi, and Zhenyi are evident in their timely manifestations. Growth, preservation, and other gases follow the laws of nature and always go hand in hand. Benevolence, ritual, and righteousness are known through knowledge, and everyone starts as a child. Compassion and shame are opposite emotions, and humility is not emotional. Heaven and man are one, like an arrow hitting the target correctly. However, heaven has no heart, and human desires are easily entangled. Without heart, there is no deception, and both are united by sincerity. Alas, if there are desires, the natural order follows the paths of thorns and brambles. Cruelty and kindness are cut away by the axe, and greed and boldness are devoured by locusts. Loss of etiquette is like cotton, and knowledge stops at the clean bottle. Heaven and man are one and two, like water separating into Weihe and Jing. Great is the ancient sage, who accepts heaven with a single thought. Looking up and down, heaven descends and rises on the earth. Peach blossoms bloom brilliantly, and beautiful birds sing sweetly. Wood energy begins to flourish, and my heart is only at peace. The bright sun spreads across the eight directions, and the movement reaches its extreme before it gives birth to tranquility. The new coolness of metal is foreshadowed, and the universe becomes increasingly crisp. All treasures are consolidated, and all flowers wither and become fragrant. The three yin aspects govern the things, and caution should be taken against color and sound. On the winter solstice, a leaf opens on the yin calendar. Although the condensed yin has been peeled away, the first yang is just starting to sprout. Observe heaven and close your eyes, covering your body and making yourself calm. If the nobles come, listen to my poetry. If you can understand this principle, you will see it clearly. If you do not understand this principle, you will be blind and deaf. Good roots come from twigs, and the beginning is slowly presented. Touching things moves compassionately, and love comes first for the young. In the beginning of spring, when the weather is warm, music and rhythm are integrated, and actions resonate like a bell and a pearl. There are 3,000 regulations, and the morning sun rises brightly. In the flourishing period of heat, when summer is at its peak, things benefit and combine with righteousness, and the taste of gold is gathered in the fall. Firm and steadfast, knowing how to know, and able to know, can be relied on in the east, south, west, and north. East is associated with wood, and south is associated with fire. North is associated with water and north, and west is associated with metal and gold. If you use them, you don't need to change them. If you use fire, it is separated from the mysterious yellow. If you use wood, it is the main green vibration. If you use metal in autumn, it is the golden talk. If you use water in winter, it is the cold water. These four are shining, please analyze them carefully. The true essence is finely combined, and I get the essence of gas. If my learning goes against this principle, I will drive south to the depths of the north. When the springs flow, the vast rivers flow. When the fire burns, it is dazzling and brilliant. Roots and shoots are nurtured, and they can stand in the sky. Wealth and wealth are truly ephemeral, and there is no need to envy the golden basket. Splendor will suddenly fade away, and there is no need to be frightened by praise and disgrace. The poisonous fairy acts as a matchmaker, and the god of money becomes the brother of affairs. If these four can be fulfilled, there will be no profit. Strong wine leads to the destruction of the family, and charming faces dominate the city. If these four can be fulfilled, desire must be punished first. Get up early in the morning and open the door, leaning on the front and rear wheels. Rest in peace at night, and respect and vigilance are always awake. Don't think that the dark room is dark, it's as bright as the sun. Don't think that leisure is idle, it's as stern as warning thunder. Kindness and violence are judged between Shun and Jie, and right and wrong are distinguished between Ke and Geng. Respect and vigilance without respect, and the cold ice is frozen with burning coals. It's either yes or no, and a valley becomes a valley in a leisurely way. Be careful not to think of a swan, and always expect to imitate a caterpillar. Sit down and I will talk to you, and the learning will start anew. There is a goal in pursuing truth, and seek oneself for standards. Try your best to serve your parents, and carefully pay attention to the cock crowing. Brothers-in-law share the same breath, and in times of difficulty, they remember each other. Women should follow the path of righteousness, and children should show filial piety. Friends should be loyal and help each other, and songs and poems echo. What is not this virtue, earnestly wear it all. What is ashamed of a hundred years, what is lacking in everything spiritual. If the four are present, they are engraved on the heart as a motto. However, benevolence and righteousness are also opposite each other. Wisdom is hidden by righteousness, and righteousness is shaped by benevolence. Just like the four seasons, yin and yang are the classic of nature. Whether it's spring and summer or warmth and growth, or autumn and winter, decline and preservation. As for benevolence and righteousness, benevolence is incomparable. Yuan is the five constant benevolence, and I follow Yi Chuan Cheng. Even more convinced that spring is benevolence, connecting like a ladder. Only benevolence is heavy, only wisdom is not light. Guard it without knowledge, and no one can overcome benevolility. You must know how to keep it firmly, and especially clearly see it. If trust is like earth and rope is like rope. The master of the door warns us not to believe, which is more important than food and weapons. There are no violations of the four ends, and there is permanence in one heart. The eternal law of heaven moves, which is different from the entanglement of desire. Progress unceasingly without boundaries, the same as Yiguanzang. This is the source of moral principles, and the source is clean, and the stream flows clear. Integrate the essence into practice, and see your face stare."

    "translate": "My ancestor, Wen Zhong of the River and Fen, has not yet repaid the favor bestowed by Confucius. I, his last descendant, wish to live up to his legacy and luckily experience peace and tranquility in this world. After traveling thousands of miles by land and water, I am able to pay homage to my ancestors at their ancestral home. Heaven wishes me to observe the Book of Rites, and fortunately, I encounter its opening. Dr. Cao, a scholar from the North, has just accepted his new assignment and is here to continue the legacy. I dare not neglect my studies in the Confucian academy and strive to practice the Six Classics in all matters. On the first day of the year in the Year of the Rat, the Great Middle Gate was opened, revealing a bright dawn. To the left, the essence was cultivated, and to the right, virtue was observed. The lights were dazzling, like stars in the night sky. Under the Quwen Pavilion, fires were lit, and the birds in the berry forest were competing to fly and make noise. Before the Golden Silk Hall, lines were arranged and the music of the bells and gongs could be heard through the echoes of the metal and stone. The descendants of the Three Families were arranged to the left and right, and the white herons were lined up on the round ponds. Respecting their elders, they took their places, and the robes of the Southerners were also involved. The ritual officials requested three times to go to the temple, and the red doors creaked open. The music of the golden joy was performed, and the offerings were arranged in order. Beginning with the worship of the first sage, the wine and food were distributed accordingly. Then went to the temples of the parents of Qi, and the rivers Si and Yi were allocated accordingly. The five worthy disciples of Confucius were honored, and their offerings were displayed sincerely. Throughout the world, the Spring and Autumn Annals are offered to the temples of culture, and the Dao of the Taoist is always present. The graves of Confuer and Taishan have been visited eight times, and its greatness rivals that of Mount Tai. It is a pity that the emperor Gaozong was born late and was unable to follow the nobles. The boundaries of the empire have been withdrawn, and the academic achievements of Du Fu and Ouyang Xun are admired. The Dao does not lie in the rooms of Fang and Du, and I am deeply ashamed of the lack of music and joy in the Fen Pavilion. Returning to give the \"Analects\" to the jade vessel, I wish to sing with the other sons and daughters. Perhaps it can repay the infinite debt, and perhaps it will not end the lives of those who are stupid and alive. I have written this song as a record of the ceremony and published it as a guide for scholars."

    "translate": "The sun and the moon move eastward, and the sky rotates to the left. I've known for a long time that the world is round like a ball. I've heard that there's a Sun Viewing Tower on Mount Tai, but I suspect that many exaggerated rumors are spread by wooden blocks and inks. It's said that holding a rooster at the top can wait for the rooster's crow, and the sea water will be cooked like porridge. The fire wheel grinds up and down, and the rocks crack loudly. The heavenly gate bell strikes to announce the dawn, and the world is sinking into chaos. Several times, I close the book, believing and being confused. How can I get wings like a flying immortal? Who knows that I am on the same track with white hair, coming to pay homage to sages and heroes in the Confucian area. Finally, I visited Qufu and climbed Mount Tai. I felt around the well and climbed to the top. I washed my feet and stayed in the true palace for the night, as if I was living in the microscopic wall. It was the night of August 20th, when the bright moon was in the constellation of Ku and Luo. I was afraid I would miss the dawn as the star dove fell, and I got up ten times all night without peace. The companions were all sleeping soundly, laughing at my crazy and reckless behavior. I sat upright in my deep clothes, unable to fall asleep, washing my stomach and intestines with the Jade Maiden Spring. The monk said to me, \"if you want to see the sun, it's time to do so now.\" I helped him pick through the grass, and then rushed ahead of everyone else. The others laughed behind them, as if they had swallowed the Dansha Yuan. I climbed the observation deck barefoot, and the east side gradually revealed a red crack. The dark clouds drifted and turned into a purple, and the golden buildings and treasures were steamed in the jade field. As the autumn deepened and the dew became heavier, my feet became wet. I longed for the sunrise and could hardly bear it. Soon, the sky was painted with a touch of eyebrows, and the precious mirror opened slightly. Up and down, up and down, and only after thousands of hardships did it finally come together. I dare not stare boldly, and I kneel down nine times, my forehead bulging, my liver and gall hanging. I picked up my shadow and cried, how easily I sank into the abyss in the past. The Sun and the Moon have lost their guests, covering the bright sun as the beginning of heaven. My small body cannot carry it, and I reluctantly drink thirsty before death. Monkeys cry, dragons cry, tigers dance, and I still wear single clothes, just covering myself with tiles. When I wake up, I suddenly climb Mount Tai and pay respect again to the clear light. I hope to protect the initial sunshine and keep the yellow road, and the brilliant Duli walks in the pure dryness. Tears in my eyes, I look down at the lower world, where the west and north are full of rising mist. The mountains are like scales, and the water is like a belt. All over the world, all the grass and trees are fresh. Looking back at the Qin Stone and Han Zhuan, the divine light gleams and the baby dragon spits out liquid. There are few sages and heroes who have ascended this place in history and culture, and they are respectful and reverent. After returning, I played and played with my shadow again, and no one could pity me when I entered or left Jin and Jin. Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty has passed away, and only the heart of the cayenne is firm. The shadows of time are valuable, and the people of the world are like vinegar flies. There are not many people who have seen the sun from Mount Deng, and such views can be used for a long time. Singing songs, I record the truth, and later, please verify my long article."

Along the cliffs, searching for the inscriptions, one can almost feel the eastern seal's touch. At the summit, the lotus petals gather, and the rocks overlook the green lands. The main path is blocked by reeds, making it time for a sheep-drawn carriage. The pearl-like treasures of the mussels cannot hide the beauty, rising to the elm trees.
