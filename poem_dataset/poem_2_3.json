With timely planting, the seedlings turn green and alive, making us feel the fragrance of the autumn wind in the rice grains."

Leaving behind all worldly concerns, we lay on the pine pillow outside, letting our names and identities drift away in the rivers and lakes."

Raising my eyes, all feelings gather; The autumn wind, the grains are scattered. How much is left of human life? Spider webs form dreams and illusions. Some sell themselves for cooking; Deception is like yoke and shift. Others engage in verbal warfare; Strategies are as intricate as those of Qin. Some pursue openness and understanding; Transforming their forms to admire Anqi. Others escape emptiness and seek enlightenment; Their hearts follow the path of a Buddhist monk. Not to say that ancient sages and worthies Have a foundation laid by heaven itself. For oneself, not for others; Accumulating knowledge is like amassing wealth. Do not waste a single day; Perhaps hundreds of aspirations will flourish. As education dissipates over time, Those with insight retreat like a retreat. Read the teachings and symbols; Morality is not governed by rules. What is noble or lowly? It is just wasted words. Advance your learning to understand; Poetry and the interpretation of the Tao. Endure poverty to know destiny; Let your family suffer hunger and cold. Pursue your art and craft; You want to be a public official. Do not forget the path to fame; Through thorns and brambles, step by step. The towering mountains and stars watch; Discussing as if they were lowly. My teacher, Confucius; And his disciples, such as Yan Hui and Zengzi. Even Mencius; The Four Books shine like a divination instrument. Your family has two brilliant descendants; Pearls and jades shine with the light of the Liang Dynasty. Yuanfang knows self-reliance; Gradually exploring the mysteries within. They learn language and conversation; They have a tendency to learn during their journey. Time flies like lightning; Sages and madmen are in danger. Filial piety is the essence of a hundred actions; Breathing deeply and smiling cheerfully. Examine the heavens and the earth; Begin from the tip of the eyebrows. Speak kindly about righteousness; Remove makeup and cosmetics from the times. Encourage yourself and encourage yourself; Do not let old age bring sadness. Use it as a warning; Show it to my children."

The chrysanthemums are still fragrant, and the autumn migratory birds pass by year after year. I miss my loved ones, and time flows like a river. With this temporary life, I am ashamed of myself in the world. It's better to be exposed to the sun first and waste time for nothing. What are my children doing? They are growing potatoes, chestnuts, cabbage, and kale. They will use these to make wine for me as the pine trees stand tall at the end of the year. I don't agree with this, and I sigh three times in disappointment. They surround me and refuse to leave, laughing and making jokes. Tao Qian and Du Fu, both of whom lived during difficult times, were also able to find joy in their lives. Although the world is narrow, destiny often favors those who are strong. This simple food and water is enough, not like the five-dish meal that is difficult to obtain. In this way, we can enjoy the company of our parents through poetry and etiquette. I respectfully ask you to accept my wishes and share in the happiness of our family. I work hard to express my feelings and listen carefully to your words. I drink too much and become drunk, taking up the pen like a madman. The general outline is shown, and the paper is full without realizing it. Call your children to sing for me, not to be passed on to the awake."

Perhaps the weather has its own fate, and the dragon is unaware of the heavenly affairs. Instead of relying on the dragon for complete solutions, return to yourself and seek the heavens. Moreover, holding paper money and seeking desires is like carrying rocks to fill the sea. There are no more than 1,000 households in the village, and the number of deceitful ghosts is unknown. The drunken world is immersed and does not blame it; who will listen to my bitter words?"

Among the weeds, a tender mushroom emerges today, just a few days old. Its soft texture seems to point to nothing, while its bright eyes gleam like polished lacquer. In the center of the courtyard, cushions are laid out and arranged, and children and adults stand around to watch what happens next. Calmly looking around, they raise their hands, holding weapons and cultural items such as poetry and books. My family has a few surviving siblings, including my brother who has seen sixty years. I have not heard of his achievements in the future, but perhaps our ancestral line will continue. In the warmth of family, we enjoy springtime, not competing for beauty on idle minds. In times of danger, I close the door and think alone, feeling that even heaven is kindtering. What my brother likes, I also like, wanting to entertain myself with candy in my later years. I know I have no merit to pass on to future generations, and that my ancestors' blessings are not yet exhausted. Looking at the famous families of Lv and Fan, so many talented children come from them. All of this comes from their accumulated virtues, and who knows if I will not become someone else in the future."

The air and its principles are inherently connected, but they have different names for humans. Emotions and rationality are interconnected, and their meaning is clear and precise. The principles of Yuanyi, Hengyi, and Zhenyi are evident in their timely manifestations. Growth, preservation, and other gases follow the laws of nature and always go hand in hand. Benevolence, ritual, and righteousness are known through knowledge, and everyone starts as a child. Compassion and shame are opposite emotions, and humility is not emotional. Heaven and man are one, like an arrow hitting the target correctly. However, heaven has no heart, and human desires are easily entangled. Without heart, there is no deception, and both are united by sincerity. Alas, if there are desires, the natural order follows the paths of thorns and brambles. Cruelty and kindness are cut away by the axe, and greed and boldness are devoured by locusts. Loss of etiquette is like cotton, and knowledge stops at the clean bottle. Heaven and man are one and two, like water separating into Weihe and Jing. Great is the ancient sage, who accepts heaven with a single thought. Looking up and down, heaven descends and rises on the earth. Peach blossoms bloom brilliantly, and beautiful birds sing sweetly. Wood energy begins to flourish, and my heart is only at peace. The bright sun spreads across the eight directions, and the movement reaches its extreme before it gives birth to tranquility. The new coolness of metal is foreshadowed, and the universe becomes increasingly crisp. All treasures are consolidated, and all flowers wither and become fragrant. The three yin aspects govern the things, and caution should be taken against color and sound. On the winter solstice, a leaf opens on the yin calendar. Although the condensed yin has been peeled away, the first yang is just starting to sprout. Observe heaven and close your eyes, covering your body and making yourself calm. If the nobles come, listen to my poetry. If you can understand this principle, you will see it clearly. If you do not understand this principle, you will be blind and deaf. Good roots come from twigs, and the beginning is slowly presented. Touching things moves compassionately, and love comes first for the young. In the beginning of spring, when the weather is warm, music and rhythm are integrated, and actions resonate like a bell and a pearl. There are 3,000 regulations, and the morning sun rises brightly. In the flourishing period of heat, when summer is at its peak, things benefit and combine with righteousness, and the taste of gold is gathered in the fall. Firm and steadfast, knowing how to know, and able to know, can be relied on in the east, south, west, and north. East is associated with wood, and south is associated with fire. North is associated with water and north, and west is associated with metal and gold. If you use them, you don't need to change them. If you use fire, it is separated from the mysterious yellow. If you use wood, it is the main green vibration. If you use metal in autumn, it is the golden talk. If you use water in winter, it is the cold water. These four are shining, please analyze them carefully. The true essence is finely combined, and I get the essence of gas. If my learning goes against this principle, I will drive south to the depths of the north. When the springs flow, the vast rivers flow. When the fire burns, it is dazzling and brilliant. Roots and shoots are nurtured, and they can stand in the sky. Wealth and wealth are truly ephemeral, and there is no need to envy the golden basket. Splendor will suddenly fade away, and there is no need to be frightened by praise and disgrace. The poisonous fairy acts as a matchmaker, and the god of money becomes the brother of affairs. If these four can be fulfilled, there will be no profit. Strong wine leads to the destruction of the family, and charming faces dominate the city. If these four can be fulfilled, desire must be punished first. Get up early in the morning and open the door, leaning on the front and rear wheels. Rest in peace at night, and respect and vigilance are always awake. Don't think that the dark room is dark, it's as bright as the sun. Don't think that leisure is idle, it's as stern as warning thunder. Kindness and violence are judged between Shun and Jie, and right and wrong are distinguished between Ke and Geng. Respect and vigilance without respect, and the cold ice is frozen with burning coals. It's either yes or no, and a valley becomes a valley in a leisurely way. Be careful not to think of a swan, and always expect to imitate a caterpillar. Sit down and I will talk to you, and the learning will start anew. There is a goal in pursuing truth, and seek oneself for standards. Try your best to serve your parents, and carefully pay attention to the cock crowing. Brothers-in-law share the same breath, and in times of difficulty, they remember each other. Women should follow the path of righteousness, and children should show filial piety. Friends should be loyal and help each other, and songs and poems echo. What is not this virtue, earnestly wear it all. What is ashamed of a hundred years, what is lacking in everything spiritual. If the four are present, they are engraved on the heart as a motto. However, benevolence and righteousness are also opposite each other. Wisdom is hidden by righteousness, and righteousness is shaped by benevolence. Just like the four seasons, yin and yang are the classic of nature. Whether it's spring and summer or warmth and growth, or autumn and winter, decline and preservation. As for benevolence and righteousness, benevolence is incomparable. Yuan is the five constant benevolence, and I follow Yi Chuan Cheng. Even more convinced that spring is benevolence, connecting like a ladder. Only benevolence is heavy, only wisdom is not light. Guard it without knowledge, and no one can overcome benevolility. You must know how to keep it firmly, and especially clearly see it. If trust is like earth and rope is like rope. The master of the door warns us not to believe, which is more important than food and weapons. There are no violations of the four ends, and there is permanence in one heart. The eternal law of heaven moves, which is different from the entanglement of desire. Progress unceasingly without boundaries, the same as Yiguanzang. This is the source of moral principles, and the source is clean, and the stream flows clear. Integrate the essence into practice, and see your face stare."

    "translate": "My ancestor, Wen Zhong of the River and Fen, has not yet repaid the favor bestowed by Confucius. I, his last descendant, wish to live up to his legacy and luckily experience peace and tranquility in this world. After traveling thousands of miles by land and water, I am able to pay homage to my ancestors at their ancestral home. Heaven wishes me to observe the Book of Rites, and fortunately, I encounter its opening. Dr. Cao, a scholar from the North, has just accepted his new assignment and is here to continue the legacy. I dare not neglect my studies in the Confucian academy and strive to practice the Six Classics in all matters. On the first day of the year in the Year of the Rat, the Great Middle Gate was opened, revealing a bright dawn. To the left, the essence was cultivated, and to the right, virtue was observed. The lights were dazzling, like stars in the night sky. Under the Quwen Pavilion, fires were lit, and the birds in the berry forest were competing to fly and make noise. Before the Golden Silk Hall, lines were arranged and the music of the bells and gongs could be heard through the echoes of the metal and stone. The descendants of the Three Families were arranged to the left and right, and the white herons were lined up on the round ponds. Respecting their elders, they took their places, and the robes of the Southerners were also involved. The ritual officials requested three times to go to the temple, and the red doors creaked open. The music of the golden joy was performed, and the offerings were arranged in order. Beginning with the worship of the first sage, the wine and food were distributed accordingly. Then went to the temples of the parents of Qi, and the rivers Si and Yi were allocated accordingly. The five worthy disciples of Confucius were honored, and their offerings were displayed sincerely. Throughout the world, the Spring and Autumn Annals are offered to the temples of culture, and the Dao of the Taoist is always present. The graves of Confuer and Taishan have been visited eight times, and its greatness rivals that of Mount Tai. It is a pity that the emperor Gaozong was born late and was unable to follow the nobles. The boundaries of the empire have been withdrawn, and the academic achievements of Du Fu and Ouyang Xun are admired. The Dao does not lie in the rooms of Fang and Du, and I am deeply ashamed of the lack of music and joy in the Fen Pavilion. Returning to give the \"Analects\" to the jade vessel, I wish to sing with the other sons and daughters. Perhaps it can repay the infinite debt, and perhaps it will not end the lives of those who are stupid and alive. I have written this song as a record of the ceremony and published it as a guide for scholars."

Along the cliffs, searching for the inscriptions, one can almost feel the eastern seal's touch. At the summit, the lotus petals gather, and the rocks overlook the green lands. The main path is blocked by reeds, making it time for a sheep-drawn carriage. The pearl-like treasures of the mussels cannot hide the beauty, rising to the elm trees. The south gate honors Meng Temple, where people in hats and sleeves move forward respectfully. From the beginning, there has been a natural pairing, and young Zhu is not necessary. After washing their hands, they meet the compassionate peace, and choose a teacher who is no longer there."

Scholars pay homage to the trees, standing and stirring up emotions from the depths of their hearts. Buildings are now few in number, as the ancient processions should be less frequent. The spring and autumn waters are secluded, with the sun and the moon illuminating the heavens and the earth. The Zhu Bridge flows like a single line, seeping into countless ponds. Entering the tomb, one sees the golden bowl, but the public officials do not consider the situation early enough. Father is heaven, and mother is earth, with bones of the dead no longer subject to life and death. The wronged spirits have departed, and who would return to the memorial archway?

There is a destiny to life and death, even for emperors. As I recall the clouds and their vibrant hues, three families dig deep wells, recording everything until the water grows cold.
