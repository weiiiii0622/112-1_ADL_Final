The fierce tigers share the three paths, and the sad monkeys learn the four meditations. Buying incense to burn the green osmanthus, begging for fire to step on the red lotus. The grass color shakes the rosy clouds, and the pine sound ripples by the moon. The river and mountain explore one hundred two, and the world connects three thousand. The Buddhist temple is just a temporary sight, and the royal city disappears. Ba Ling leaves the trees, and the Wei River is about to touch the sky. The remote counties are divided into various towns, and solitary villages rise with white smoke. Looking at the clouds, I think of the wise monarch, and revealing the fog hides the group of worthy people. The humble official feels ashamed of his simple job, and he wants to be involved in Taoism all his life. Who knows that the hermitage guest once composed the \"Bai Liang\" article with cypress."

The fierce tigers share the three paths, and the sad monkeys learn the four meditations. Buying incense to burn green osmanthus, begging for fire to step on red lotuses. Grass colors shake the clouds, pine sounds ripple by the moon. The river and mountain encompass a hundred two, the world connects three thousand. The Buddhist temple is just a temporary resting place, the royal city is finally distant. Ba Ling leaves the trees, the Wei River is about to touch the sky. Distant counties are divided into red gates, solitary villages rise from white smoke. Looking at the clouds, I think of the sovereign, through the fog, I remember the group of worthy ones. The humble official is ashamed of his simple job, and he wants to be involved in Buddhism all his life. Who knows that the hermit guest has once composed poems with Bai Liang."

The emperor says, \"My master, please rid us of the foul smells.\" That day, I depart from the west of Qin, traveling east to Qi Chun. The wind of the Dharma connects with the balance of the bamboo, and the land borders on Wu and Chu. There were few believers in the past, but many fishermen and hunters now approach me. Upon my arrival, they abandon their nets by the riverside and pay homage to atone for their past misdeeds, hoping for better karma in the future. As time goes on, my duties are fulfilled, and I no longer stay physically. I return to the Huai River and the Yangtze River, then again to the Jing River estuary. At the Jing River, I reside near the Buddhist hall, where birds come to listen to lectures and animals do not intrude. It is not yet time for all connections to be severed, and I remain responsible for teaching. Therefore, since I have come here, I will always carry the subtle sound of the Dharma. In the bamboo room, I see my belongings and possessions, and in the pine room, I cleanse my body and mind. I regret the shallow karma I have accumulated and can find a plan for success later. Praise be to Master Yuan's righteousness, which is as pure as gold."

Straight up to the solitary peak, all other mountains appear small. In the warm southern land, ice and snow are scarce during the twelfth month. Green foliage covers the cold mountains, with vines and ivy shrouding the winter pools. Near the flower altar and waterfall, the green walls stand tall with stone forests at their peaks. Bells ring, summoning humans and gods, while rice is distributed to gather monkeys and birds. Cleansing one's mind returns to purity, as one's heart becomes empty and aware. Only then does one understand that people in the world are troubled by countless things."

Bright green forests lie horizontally, misty green mountains are faint. The distant village is reflected more clearly, solitary cranes come nearby. Winning atmosphere is glad to meet, fairyland is hard to visit. Old friends work in the capital, they are usually relaxed and free.

Separated from Jing and Wu, I drift through the Yi and Si rivers. Waiting for a boat on the vast river, the steep slope hurts the swift horse. Lost on the way home, I wander in a lowly position. Traveling west to the Taihua Mountains and north to the Shaoliang region. The verdant villages and vast rivers and valleys fill my sight. Ashamed to follow the path of bravery, I am content to be a scribe. The precious sword and the bagpipe are not forgotten, for true companionship is valued. The great path is broad, and rising and sinking do not seem so different."

    "translate": "Physically, there is no end; I miss you in your middle years. Although I have not deeply explored the path yet, I am admired by all. As an official, I suffer from poverty and low status; as a guest, I lack farmland and gardens. Rich soil cannot be sought; it is located in the west. Surrounded by mulberry trees and pomegranates, a wall separates my home from others. In mourning, my spirit is constantly changing. The thatched roof leans over, with two coffins placed between the pillars. From time to time, I hear the cries of the orphan; they echo through the fields. The crows fly and cry loudly; the fierce animals also rest. My old friend Wang, I silently contemplate the teachings of life. Sadness and joy have long been absent; hearing them will make me shed tears. The sun hides in the empty sky; the rain and snow float on the green mountains. I journey far to visit my ancestors; I feel sadness in my heart. Accepting what is given and being at peace with the world; these are just empty words."

Pen in hand, writing in the morning, the imperial chambers, the purple throne. The imperial city is a magnificent sight, adorned with springlike garments. The emperor practices modesty and simplicity, leading a clean and frugal life. The high officials have empty positions, as the world rushes to gather dust. You, with your good reputation and fine character, your virtuous reputation never ends. The Emperor deposes the scholars, the literary emperor exiles the talented. The court may be prosperous, but exile is hard to rely on. Traveling through the vast river valley, traversing the green peaks. These words are merely tainted, like the impurities in white jade. The silent voice is for all, the profound understanding is only for oneself. Knowing each other leads to separation, as time flows endlessly. My heart is broken by dreams, my anger grows with each passing year. Flowers bloom in the Peony Palace, spring deepens in the morning and evening pools. Leaving you a long-distance gaze, forever looking at the white clouds."

The lonely crane perches in the thorns, one branch is not its true home. Its wings yearn to soar high into the sky, desiring to reach the clouds. The high terrace is so lofty, the rocks and stones flow with rushing water. One knows that it is not the celestial pool, its cries and leaps are shared by all. Who would pity its solitary withered state, forty years along the mighty river? Reflect on oneself and value one's own knowledge, strive for modest positions and follow one's abilities. The broken wings mourn the strong wind, suffering hunger and waiting for morning meals. The lake's moon reflects the vast ocean, the sky is so vast and open.
