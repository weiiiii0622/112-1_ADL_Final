It's already over."

The poet still retains the air of a child, enjoying luxurious homes and lamenting the hills. The flowers and reeds can ease my sorrow, while herons and white cranes can accompany me in my travels. Look at the furs and helmets, all pressing down on my head - who would have known that beneath the stone railing, I would buy a bamboo hat and sail off on a misty rain boat? Do not needlessly anticipate the concerns of home and country, nor foolishly present strategies and plans. Fame and wealth are but fleeting, only the cuckoo can be a companion in planning."

My sleep is interrupted by the remnants of a book resting on a lazy shelf, and I rise from my bath, covering myself with a fine silk robe.

An old man in his eighties endures hunger, sitting alone in the empty hall. This year, due to the extra month, it's cold in September. We dare not yet discuss the charcoal from Mount Nan. Fortunately, we manage to have a meal, and our worries disappear before the lamp. My son brings his books, sometimes discussing difficult topics with me. As long as he shares my interests, there's no need to worry about conflicts at the door."

Building a cottage in seclusion, I know little of the new; belonging to illness, my old learning is neglected.

I feel that my body is still a burden, so I reserve prickly shrubs for snow and frost."

There are still temples left to seek divine guidance."

Flowers greedily bear fruit, leaving no petals behind; swallows catch insects to feed their young. Flutes and drums compete in celebration, as people get drunk; irrigation ditches are moved to plant rice, with guests calling out to each other. In the capital of Chang'an, horses with golden reins and blue coverings gallop; farmers also enjoy this pleasure, far from the chaos of the world."

The sparse trees drop their leaves late, and the distant village lights up even brighter. Although the poem is hastily written, it is enough to express deep emotions."

The clothespole and pestle make sad letters; the fisherman's song breaks the traveler's spirit. Old friends have all passed away, who can understand this feeling?"

I am indifferent to things around me and accept people with a distant attitude. The vast universe may seem vast, but it is all equal to a temporary dwelling."

The mountain boy carries a load of red fruits for sale, while the village girl gathers jade-like flowers along the fence.

Some officials may be excessively demanding, and those who amass wealth are also ruthless. It's like being caught in a net across the river; who can escape effortlessly? The foundation of politics is to nurture the people, and this argument is not impractical. Although I have retired, I have participated in government discussions.

It is a difficult task for even the wise King Yu to control what is beyond his reach. Do not deem wheat porridge as meager; it sustains us during plowing, muddying our calves. Earthenware bowls and bamboo containers hold our salted and fermented milk, alongside a variety of leafy vegetables.
