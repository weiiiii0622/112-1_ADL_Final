To add moonlight to the west-facing windows, we are willing to collect flowers from the South Sea. Intending to create a secluded marsh on the ground, we plan to bring the mountains closer to the small stage. As the pristine scenery deepens, the official duties become heavier; in springtime, it is always others who come to visit."

The unyielding river is where the barbarian general perishes, as the dust from the conquered city lies vacant outside the receiving city. The flag's seam resembles a bird's wing, while the arrow is adorned with a finely carved feather, chasing after the fiercest birds of prey. Pointing to the highest stone of the Yan Mountain, one cannot know who deserves the credit for these remarkable achievements."

Who knew that the dim remaining light in the northern window would accompany the waning crescent moon over the western tower? The long night should still be going on, and the distant smoke should not be frequently heard to break. The sojourner has spent three years like this, waiting for the dawn cock without warming his cold quilt."

The crimson river's waves are shallow, don't let them separate us; the vast ocean's waves are deep, yet they still stir up dust. The celestial phoenix in the heavens is lonely; the magpies of the world toil endlessly. Leaning on the railing on the north side of the palace tower, there are countless people staying awake all night."

Sitting here, I worry about my absent thoughts as the morning approaches; how can the moon goddess be aware of all these details?"

At the end of drinking, three elegant games are played, and a hundred beauties compete in koo. The golden bee has new wings, and the old scent of the golden duck has faded. The water is so clear that it seems like a polished silk, and the lone rosy cloud seems to be ready to stand out. Parting comes with the prompt of the Qin pillar, and sorrow is accompanied by the sound of the Shu string. It is difficult to cure the mysterious ailments, and one suffers from acute pain in Linqu. A poem is written to seek weak cotton, and a friend is remembered to sing about the sweet banana tree. Wang Shuai pities all of the Xie family, and Zhou Yu definitely marries Xiao Qiao.

    "poem": "萬古離懷憎物色，幾生愁緒溺風光。\n廢城沃土肥春草，野渡空船蕩夕陽。\n倚道向人多脈脈，爲情因酒易倀倀。\n宦途棄擲須甘分，迴避紅塵是所長。",
    "translate": "Down the centuries, I hate to see things, and for countless lives, I'm drowned in the beauty of the wind and light. In the abandoned city, fertile soil nourishes spring grass, while wild boats drift with the setting sun by the deserted ferry. Leaning on the road, I gaze at people with affectionate glances, and because of love, I become easily swayed by wine. On the journey of official life, one must accept their fate; avoiding the dusty world is our strength."

    "poem": "動非求進靜非禪，咋舌吞聲過十年。\n溪漲浪花如積石，雨晴雲葉似連錢。\n干戈歲久諳戎事，枕簟秋涼減夜眠。\n攻苦慣來無不可，寸心如水但澄鮮。",
    "translate": "Dynamic not for seeking progress, static not for meditation; Over the past decade, I have passed through silently, with my tongue tied and voice swallowed. The stream rises, and the waves are like accumulated stones; The rain clears, and the clouds resemble connected coins. After years of war, I am familiar with military affairs; As autumn cools the pillow and mat, my night sleep is reduced. I have become accustomed to hard work and perseverance; My heart is like a clear pond, always fresh and clean."

    "translate": "A garden of redness intoxicates the slope, with branches intertwined in a mass of bright red. The soul of Sichuan has not yet returned, dripping blood ceaselessly, causing more bloodstains to accumulate in this cluster."

    "poem": "橋下淺深水，竹間紅白花。\n酒仙同避世，何用厭長沙。",
    "translate": "Beneath the bridge, shallow and deep water flows; among the bamboo, red and white flowers bloom. The wine immortal shares this secluded world, what need is there for tiredness in Changsha?"

    "poem": "西山爽氣生襟袖，南浦離愁入夢魂。\n人泊孤舟青草岸，鳥鳴高樹夕陽村。\n偷生亦似符天意，未死深疑負國恩。\n白面兒郎猶巧宦，不知誰與正乾坤。",
    "translate": "The cool breeze from the western mountains caresses our sleeves, and the sorrow of parting at the southern banks haunts our dreams. A lonely boat moored by the green grass shore, birds singing high in the trees as the sunset illuminates the village. Surviving seems to conform to Heaven's will, but I doubt if I am truly fulfilling my duty to my country. Young and cunning officials with pale faces continue to rise through the ranks, who knows who will ultimately correct the world's balance?"

    "poem": "漸覺人心望息兵，老儒希覬見澄清。\n正當困辱殊輕死，已過艱危却戀生。\n多難始應彰勁節，至公安肯爲虛名。\n暫時胯下何須恥，自有蒼蒼鑒赤誠。",
    "translate": "As people's desire for peace grows, the old scholar hopes to see things clear. In times of hardship and humiliation, death seems light; after surviving adversity, life is cherished. Through trials, integrity shines; in safety, true fame is earned. There's no shame in temporary defeat; the universe witnesses our sincerity."

    "translate": "Residing by the riverside, the autumn wind is lonely. The purple clay award is empty, and the white hair has become a fisherman and woodcutter. Past events are sad, and the willpower is fading in times of danger. If I am about to decay, I still want to support the government."
