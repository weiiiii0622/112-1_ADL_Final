How can I contribute to great discussions? Where will I find an answer to their inquiries? Producing eloquent words requires skillful rhetoric, and studying classics enhances one's knowledge.

Embracing the many nuances of life, I strive for elegance and avoid superficiality. Since ancient times, heroes have flourished, and today's cities sing their praises. Who has come close to understanding the depths, and who possesses the talents of the past? My secluded atmosphere weighs on me, and I lament the loss of friends. Drunkenness and intoxication wash away my sorrow, as I sink deeper into bliss. My wit is often wasted, as I struggle to find worthy companions. I do not wish to hurt others, nor do I want to be ashamed by forcing a smile. Like Guan Yu, I face challenges, while Dong Zhuo lies asleep in his tower. My enthusiasm wanes with age, as my sword and books gather dust."

Your sorrow rises to present it to the banished immortal, and your dreams are created by his guidance. Opening the back hall, flowers and willows flourish, and their fragrant skin can create a thousand six snowflifts. With jade steps and lotus flowers, one doesn't consider themselves light, and the cold eyes cannot give further instructions. Holding a jade cup and pouring red pearls, one drunkenly enjoys themselves among the flowers; it is not easy to plan such a feast, and after returning, one's heart is entangled for ten days. The Lanling family style is similar to the imperial capital, and it also emerges from the city of flowers. The willow waist travels ten thousand miles with the wind, and where is there no return journey? Let the iron heart of Song Guangping enjoy the plum blossoms at night while wiping away his drunken eyes. The art of singing and dancing in Zhao is more refined, and it cannot be evaluated whether it blocks the clouds or returns the snow. There are no more than a few fairy maiden in the world, and the naked eye is amazed by the game of immortals. I don't care about the glory of ten thousand bells, and I am intoxicated by wine and flowers as if I were in Penglai. What is the need for a grand gathering with four things, and one can write high emotions with bare feet. I hate that Su Dongpo is a public official in the world, and his family reputation often tips the nine barbarians. Among the fashionable crowd, he puts down his weapons and asks his neighbor to hold his wine cup. When will the high tower bell sound, as my heart is drunk like spring dew?"

The creek's beautiful light reflects like a red silk section, and the wind caresses the willow branches like golden threads. Who knows who I meet everywhere without hindrance, for I am no longer here. When I understand the Buddha through the head of the guest, I show my long eyebrows to others."

Spiritually attuned, we enter the depths of meditation without restraint. The wind whips, the sea moves, and the whale sheds its skin. The moon shines brightly, the sand is cold, and the herons do not sleep. Adaptable to all situations, we can transform and navigate the vast ocean on a floating ship."

Bending over to pick the laurel, I relax and touch the cold moon; holding the pearls in my mouth, I dream of wandering through spring. In the courtyard, I no longer see the rainbows or the birds; the deer and the elk come to call on the spirits of the valley. My neighbors, the five old men, return to ask for news; we laugh and talk with each other as our white hair turns new."

It swallows the clouds and dreams in its vast chest, displaying the beauty of the Taihang Mountains on its brows.

With complete silence, the Gate of Non-Duality opens as it should have. As Buddhist affairs come full circle, I think of returning home, and the paths outside the door are level and wide like a hand.
