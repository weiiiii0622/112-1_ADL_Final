Standing on the cliff, I gaze at Xianyang, where the royal palace is spread across the north pole. Thousands of wells are astonished by the painted scenes, and the nine thoroughfares are straight like strings. The Wei River flows clear, crossing the sky without stopping. In the court and the wilderness, there are abundant cultural relics, and the attire is magnificent. The stables are filled with horses scattered throughout the mountains, and the military presence is formidable in distant regions. Yi and Gao govern the original transformation, while Wei and Huo contribute their strength. The songs and bells continue to play, but the glory and old age are approaching. The full moon passes through the waning and waxing phases, and the sun moves from the center to the decline. The east sea gold does not disperse, and why do the west birds hide? Do not make the sorrow of Mount Niu, and the sorrowful tears wet your chest."

The fierce tiger swings its tail, sharpening its teeth in the icy frost. Plants and trees cannot be eaten, so we drink dew from the sky. We sigh at the hardships of traveling northward, pausing our horses to mourn. When will the righteous way be peaceful, allowing us to see the light of day?"

The river touches the mountains for tens of thousands of miles, creating whirlpools and eddies in the land of Qin. Glory and energy mix together in vibrant colors, with a sage appearing once every thousand years. The giant spirit roars and splits two mountains apart, with surging waves shooting like arrows toward the East Sea. The three peaks seem about to collapse, with verdant cliffs and red valleys opening high above. The Jade Emperor harnesses the primordial energy, creating a stone lotus and cloud platform. The cloud platform connects to the hidden path, where the immortal lives who can never die. The stars and jade women are prepared for cleaning and tidying, with Ma Gu gently scratching her back and fingernails. The emperor holds the gates of heaven and earth, discussing heavenly matters with the immortal from the Danshui Valley. Radiant light shines through the nine heavens as it enters and exits, traveling east to Penglai and then westward again. If you are kindle enough to share the elixir with your old friends, ride on the two cattail dragons and soar up to heaven."

They were separated for ten years, and now they have returned after a long time. The frost has settled on their hair in the morning, and the dew has formed on their clothes. They see the green water pavilion, with its doors open and luxurious carpets laid out. They spend their wealth to entertain noblemen, inviting only exceptional guests. They want to pick the moon's laurel branches and use them as firewood for the cold. They laugh at the side of the road, wondering what fate awaits them in the heavens. If they are shown mercy, they will repay their debt to the earth by serving their benefactors."

Warm air turns cold valleys into ashes, and smoke and fire are born and die. You ascend the Phoenix Pool, suddenly giving up Jia Sheng's talent. Jie's dog still barks at Xiaoyao, and the Xiongnu laughs at a thousand years. I sigh four or five times in the middle of the night, often worrying about the big country."

The cup of purple caviar was once proud to be passed on. Good plans sweep the desert, dreams linger around the banner. Wealth and nobility become distant day by day, and the wish is far away. Climbing the dragon has the straight road, leaning on jade blocks the beautiful banquet. Dare to present the strategy of surrounding the court, thinking of Guo Tai ship together.

Recalling those days in Nanyang, I first received the favor of the country's nobles. You were a pillar of history, removing embroidery to return to your countryside. In the past, you wore a white pen, chasing ghosts in the obscure capital. Holding an axe, you led the troops, clearing the northern gates of the world. As a governor, you managed two districts, and the eagle took flight again. Incense was burned in the Orchid Platform, and many beautiful words were drafted. Kui Long's gaze was heavy, and the proud phoenix soared. The thundering sound of the red land resonates, and the strong-willed emperor hears it. The magnificent trees are toppled by the strong wind, and the path becomes more solid. As a governor, you have ruled three districts, and the beasts have fled from your residence. The displaced people are like guard ravens, mistakenly ascending the carriage of Yi Gong. Laughing at my eastern city shoes, I feel embarrassed by the white fur coat. I casually stroll among the bamboo and rocks, and the essence of righteousness forgets day and night. My appearance has withered, and the winds and clouds are not worth discussing. Monkeys ride on earth oxen, and weak horses are sandwiched between the front wheels. I wish to borrow the image of the ancient emperor, shining on the upside-down basket. If the vast ocean does not surge, how can the giant prawns soar freely? What I expect is the clear and mysterious river, where I can soar effortlessly."

General Zong assists in ruling the heroic county, with water and land transportation interconnected. The long river flows through the middle, draining thousands of miles to unite Wu and Kuai. Your heart is also like this, embracing all things great and small. With your pen, you create wind and frost, showing sincerity and bonding with benevolence. The court of litigation bears peach and apricot trees, while the guesthouse is filled with elegant canopies. How could we have expected the wispy clouds of Caowu to suddenly meet? Fate has separated us from our loved ones, leaving us alone in the sacred Ming Dynasty. It is not easy to find a connoisseur, so I grip my sword and feel even more emotion.

The purple sash brings joy and harmony, while the yellow chrysanthemums stimulate one's interest. Mountains can be seen on maps, and streams flow back into mirrors. One admires the festivities of the Double Ninth Festival, which should have passed the Horse-racing Terrace."

One day, they fly away, and the phoenix and the peacock both cry. In the scorching fifth month, the vermilion sun shines brightly on the river bank. You are engaged in a boat journey, causing my soul to be sad. There is no green grass in Qin Dynasty, and the south clouds make noise like drums and gongs. The king reduces his jade meal, getting up early to think about the crowing rooster. Dredging the canal to save Guan and Fu, allowing the tired people to avoid mud. The prime minister makes rain, allowing farmers to plow with their cattle. Calm people hide in the grass, while talented people fill the golden gate. There are no brave men with empty hands, and living in poverty makes people low. See you off to Huang Mountain, where you lean against the sky ladder and howl. Small boats are like ducks and geese, while large boats are like whales. Unfurling the sail to disperse the long wind, rolling up with the clouds. As the sun sets over the Ox Point, the murky evening smoke fills the sky. Where does your love for each other lie? It is far to the west of Luoyang."

The dragons and kylins are born in response to destiny, opening the era of Kaiyuan to sweep away the fog. The great microcosm expands like a golden mirror, upholding the clear distant descendants. Light dust gathers on the mountains and hills, vaguely expressing the brilliance of life. Misleading letters are sent out with purple clay, offering and presenting the azure sky. Slanderous rumors confuse the mind of the noble ruler, while the plans of deceitful ministers are neglected. He hesitates beneath the palace gates, sighing at the passing of time. Before writing Zhong Xian's poetry, he weeps as Jia Yang does. Setting sail on the autumn river, he is not constrained by the clouds. The mountains and seas tilt eastward, and the countless rivers have endless power. I am separated from the cicada by more than a thousand years. In a broad era, heroes and wits are rare, embracing each other remotely. Gazing at the distant water from the boat, he suddenly sees the emerald wave. Where does the high-minded man come from? His empty boat is tied gently. His clothing and appearance are simple and ancient, and his writings are full of beauty. He welcomes his hometown friends, their moral principles have not yet been lost. Gu Hu is eloquent in silence, and Quan Zi understands the universal cover. They were once part of the same cloud, lingering together. The double water lily flowers easily float and turn, and the solitary crane yearns to soar. Tomorrow morning, he will leave Xiangxiang and together pay homage to the emperor of Caoyang."

The barbarian horses run through the grasslands, and the proud conquer the central plains. The wise craftsman feels the declining fate, and the cloud-like pigeon suddenly flies upward. The assembled troops shine in the Chu State, and the banners connect to the sea gate. A million soldiers of the Western Qin are like a cloud of weapons. They can fill the river with their whips and sweep it away without discussion. The imperial fortune returns to normal, and the ugly enemy has no remaining soul. Laughter stops the flood, and the people look forward to its survival. Visit the ancient sites in the smelting city, where there is still Xie An's mound. Look at the dangerous terrain of the Zhou Dynasty, which is high and isolated from human noise. Imagine the east hill's appearance, and cherish the right army's words. The phoenix tree recognizes the fine trees, and the sweet grass leaves behind its fragrance. The white herons reflect in the spring shore, and the green dragon appears in the morning sun. The ancient land has its own clouds and things, and the platform leans on the millet and millet. I come to taste the clear waves, and plant famous gardens here. When the job is done, brush off your clothes and go back to the Wulingyuan."

By mistakenly inscribing my name in the golden scroll, I am able to communicate with the silver platform. Waiting for an imperial summons, I compose verses praising the clear breeze. Returning in the evening twilight, I gallop on a cloud-like steed. People and horses have no intention of their own, but race proudly. Entering the gate, there are purple mandarin ducks and golden double walnut trees. Singing ancient melodies, we drink fine wine from Xinfeng. Enjoy this moment and share it with your fellow officials. The time flies by, and life is like a wandering plant. Reaching success early is better than meeting it late, and one should be ashamed to compare themselves to a fisherman."

The general is moved by jealousy and suspicion, and the royal army suddenly turns against its own. Since coming to the whitecaps on the sandbar, they shout and make noise on the Dan Yang shore.

On the boat, one's finger can be pointed to easily; on the city wall, bones are fought over for cooking. Hastily exiting the nearby pass, one walks unaware of previous calculations. The south runs like a rapid fire, while the north has no end to its enemies. One lacks a seven-treasured whip, lingering to play by the road. The sun eats the crescent moon in the night, and the long rainbow pierces the sky during the day. The armies of Qin and Zhao rise, causing chaos throughout the nine provinces. Encountering the benevolent ruler's favor, one's thoughts rise high, like those of Emperor Gao. Crossing the river, one swears by the flowing water, determined to cleanse the central plains. Drawing one's sword and striking the front pillar, one sings a sad song that cannot be repeated."

    "translate": "The vast and indigo moon over Jinling, hanging high above the imperial lands. The celestial constellations align, as the mighty river flows through the course of history. The green waters have dried up, leaving no path for horses to gallop, while the verdant pines have been destroyed, covering ancient mounds with their shadow. The tower leans, its ornate watchtower crumbling, while the palace has vanished, leaving only the former site of the phoenix tower. In the abandoned palaces, one mourns the passing of summer, while the fragrant gardens are no longer a place for joyous excursions. A song is sung, reminding one of the beauty of the jade trees, as the desolation of autumn descends upon the former pleasure gardens."

    "poem": "悽悽去親愛，泛泛入煙霧。\n歸棹洛陽人，殘鐘廣陵樹。\n今朝此爲別，何處還相遇。\n世事波上舟，沿洄安得住。",
    "translate": "Sad to leave the beloved, drifting into the mist. Returning oars of the Luoyang people, remnants of the Guangling trees. Today we part, where will we meet again? The world's affairs are like a boat on waves, how can we stay safe and steady along our journey?"

    "poem": "前舟已眇眇，欲渡誰相持。\n秋山起暮鐘，楚雨連滄海。\n風波離思滿，宿昔容鬢改。\n獨鳥下東南，廣陵何處在。",
    "translate": "The former boat has already faded, who will hold the rope to cross? The autumn mountains ring with the evening bell, and the Chu rain connects with the vast ocean. The waves of separation fill my thoughts, and my hair and beard have changed over the night. A solitary bird descends to the southeast, where is the city of Guangling?"

    "poem": "忽報南昌令，乘驄入郡城。\n同時趨府客，此日望塵迎。\n文苑臺中妙，冰壺幕下清。\n洛陽相去遠，猶使故林榮。",
    "translate": "Suddenly the news of Nanchang's magistrate arrives, riding a horse into the county town. At the same time, the guests rush to the government office, eagerly awaiting their meeting. The literary pavilion is filled with exquisite beauty, and the ice-clear screen casts a refreshing shade. Although Luoyang is far away, its influence still brings glory to the old forest."

    "poem": "息駕依松嶺，高閣一攀緣。\n前瞻路已窮，既詣喜更延。\n出巘聽萬籟，入林濯幽泉。\n鳴鐘生道心，暮磬空雲煙。\n獨往雖暫適，多累終見牽。\n方思結茅地，歸息期暮年。",
    "translate": "Parking the carriage by the pine-covered ridge, I climb to the high tower. The path ahead seems to have reached its end, but I'm glad to continue exploring. Emerging from the mountains, I listen to the sound of nature; entering the forest, I bathe in the clear spring water. The ringing bells awaken my spiritual heart, while the evening chimes drift through the misty clouds. Although solitude brings temporary comfort, the weight of worldly concerns always pulls me back. As I contemplate building a humble home, I look forward to returning there in my old age to rest and relax."

    "poem": "東洛何蕭條，相思邈遐路。\n策駕復誰遊，入門無與晤。\n還因送歸客，達此緘中素。\n屢暌心所歡，豈得顏如故。\n所歡不可暌，嚴霜晨淒淒。\n如彼萬里行，孤妾守空閨。\n臨觴一長嘆，素欲何時諧。",
    "translate": "The eastern capital is desolate, longing for you in distant lands. Who would accompany me on my journey, no one to enter my door? I send off a departing guest, conveying this message inside. Our hearts are constantly parted, our faces cannot remain as they were. Our joy cannot be separated, the cold morning frost. Like those who travel thousands of miles, I stay alone in my empty chamber. I take a long sigh, when will our happiness be restored?"
