Red makeup is seen among the wealthy doors. Intentively pushing the door closed, it seems to teach others how to convey messages. Feng Yan strikes his saddlebag with his whip, half brushing the willows and half stirring the smoke. The spring birds in the trees understand human intentions, silently conveying their deep expectations. It is said that Zhang Yin prefers wine, making the boudoirs fragrant for me. The sparrows on the roof fight in vain, while Yin drinks and lies drunk, not knowing the fear of being deceived. Yan hides behind the window fan, with a towel beside her pillow, ready to be taken. Who would have thought that Feng could endure such cruelty, waiting for him with deep emotions. Turning around, she thinks it's hard to get the towel, but when she turns it over, she knows it's a frost blade. Feng Yan hesitates as he touches his sword, not deceiving himself in his life. If you can deceive him, you must be deceived; who else can be used? The red splendor in the window can still be grasped, and the love for the flower ornaments is insufficient. Only by upholding justice can one's heart and mind be cleared, and the initial turning of the delicate jade-like neck is cut. The phoenix hairpins are broken and scattered, and the beautiful spirits and souls are nowhere to be found. Calling for a visit to the Golden Valley, she is ashamed of the mocking tears on her clothes. The new hides and the old rises, causing noise during the day, shocking neighbors. Accusing Zhang Yin of not explaining himself, he avoids death and avoids being punished by torture. The official is about to be arrested in the dust, as people come to watch. Do not pass on the false accusations, for the murder of Zhang Yin's child is my fault. When I first heard the words of the officials, I was suspicious and did not change my madness. The prisoner is released but still doubts, thinking it's a dream. Don't urge him to speak falsely; let him know the difficulties of danger. The virtuous Marquis Jia, a white horse hero, offers gold and silk to recruit talented heroes. He petitions to redeem Feng Yan's crimes, leaving an eternal righteous wind in the three rivers. The Yellow River flows eastward without stopping, and its name does not perish. Thanking the poet Shen Xiaoren, he sings longer and speaks more clearly. Feng Yan's spirit is still alive, leaving a warning for humanity. Cast into golden swallows and fragrant piles, incense is burned and wine is drunk, while songs are listened to."

Naturally, there will be no more wars with the barbarians. In the leisurely Office of Ethnic Affairs, he drives sheep all his life."

Wu Jing compiled the source of peace, laying out ten matters clearly on paper. Today, my descendants have such achievements, who will present them to the emperor? When the imperial carriage hunts Zuo Feng, the divine eagle will fly a thousand miles. I play with my crazy calligraphy on the barbarian paper, and I don't care if others laugh at me."

What teachings and teachers, born to live and die. Without classics or laws, we struggle alongside each other like stubborn shoulders. The Three Sovereigns truly worked, and the Five Emperors truly governed. They created heaven and earth, and there was no dusk or collapse. Their words were not arranged, and their writings were accepted by the sages. Clearly seen as if present, no one can compare to history. Thus, the simple rope and knot are abandoned, and the truth is simplified as such. The emperor's edict and the minister's ode, the script on the cylinder and the hair on the net. The former books and the latter classics, to guide goodness and reflect evil. The great chapter of the country, how can it be neglected? Alas! The virtuous period is full of sighs, and the long seal is full of affirmations. The court discusses daily, and the hall plans daily. The demons do not create, and the birds and mice are not removed. Discourses do not cover, and plans do not bend. The historical officials are straight, and the historical robes are straight. They stare blankly, and they slip away miserably. The pen is raised in front of them, and the defense is accepted for contamination. Do not imprison your intelligence, and do not extinguish my ignorance. Speak directly, and record history directly. Therefore, the bright legal matters and the lonely court speeches can be found. The sagely records are many, and the Yao style is not shallow. The annals are compiled, and the rulers appear. As if you are wearing a tassel, as if you are wearing a crown. In the vast halls and courtyards, there is no peaceful banquets. The Three Sovereigns do not perish, and the Five Emperors are not cut off. Emperor Taizong obtained it, and history was exhibited. Until the later emperors drew themselves, and the emperor asked exclusively. I speak alone, and history cannot approach. When Qiu Ming was suspected, Yi Xiang was excluded. Holding the pen now, I follow the ranks without advancing. The ranks retire, and the history returns. No one can see the questions, and the good plans are rare. Taking the imperial edicts, I earn my salary for the benefit of the country. Brightly at the time of the emperor, words must become a chapter. The virtue of the emperor promotes the five emperors, and the Tao of the three emperors is profound. How can the following ministers, who are eager for meat and fond of gluttony, be compared? They sharpen their beaks and claws, and they are confined by the rod and the support. Controlling their subordinate positions, they guard the sunlight. Their private partitions have been used up, and their history has escaped from Tang Dynasty. Let the favorable sound be inquired about quietly, and let the dark death be silently withdrawn. The classics are silent, and the law is covered. How can this be achieved, and the historical texts are not spread? Later, it will not be laughed at, and the future will be either good or bad. It is said that the hall is empty, and the screen is missing. No one knows about the evils concealed, and the text loses its vastness. There are the achievements of the virtuous period and the regulations of the long seal. They are also hidden and not seen, and they are also sleeping and not prominent. Fortunately, there are later ministers, and this speech is not flattering. Yi Yin has a straight heart, and Ta Ji needs a saint. Once the matter can be written, why can't history be commanded? Previously deceived, displayed openly. Said, \"Follow the analogy of history, please use things together.\" If ten people plant poplars, one person wants to compete. The planting is not firm, and the exclusion cannot be strong. The emperor's business is like planting, and the pursuit of history is like exclusion. Emperor Mu was sad, as if he had a sickness or a weakness. What kind of minister was he in the past, hiding my ancestors correctly? He did not pass on his personal questions, and he did not write down his secret arguments. Who will show up in the future, shining the divine politics? Therefore, the emperor's breath is shaken and inhaled, and the recruitment is urgently called. The historical title is written, and he enters the court loudly. He listens carefully and raises his eyes, neither pushing nor holding. The horned dragon turns its head, and the snake dra"

Weighing the needs of all the provinces, we must level out the land; waiting for the time to cultivate the strong, we will eradicate them all. I have not yet achieved the emperor's ambitions, and it is unbearable to send the royal carriage to the west. Frequently pining for the Nine Mysterious Mountains, I once shared water and fish with my subordinates."

After a full night's sleep, the scenery is still early, the initial breeze is refreshing. Unfolding the small screen and gathering up clothes, there are still melancholy matters that I can't seem to forget. Combing my white hair in the mirror, it's pitiful to see ice reflecting frost."

The remaining hues of the mountains are like a rolled-up brocade, while the meandering river creates a pattern of scales. In Luoyang, many leisurely travelers know each other well, rarely venturing out to the mountains but often in the city. The elderly merchants and the free-spirited scholars meet and greet each other. Traveling eighteen li south from the Ding Gate, along the well-maintained bridges and paths, one experiences a pleasant climate without too much cold or heat. Riding alongside each other, we pause on the west bank, allowing our boats to gently glide around the center. With an open mind and no attachments, the beauty surrounding us is indescribable. As the lotus begins to wither, the yellow eelgrass remains green, and fish leap for joy while owls remain unperturbed. The long, emerald tendrils of the waterweed resemble peacock tails, while the colorful boat oars create the sound of cold geese. A cup of homebrewed wine and some wildflowers create a tranquil atmosphere. As the sun sets in the west during the day, and the eastern sky brightens at night, we take a brief pause from our drinking and poetry recitals. I have a madman's words to share, and you shall listen. A man has two aspirations in life: to help others and to enjoy solitude; it is difficult to achieve both. If one cannot heal the suffering of the people, they must at least cleanse themselves of worldly desires. Considering my aging eyes and declining vision, what accomplishments can I truly make in such a short time? Instead, let us laugh and drink ourselves into a stupor, lying in the beauty of the Xiangshan Mountains."

They realized their enlightenment in the forests of Ji and Ying, and Hao returned to Shangdian. It's not just about enjoying seclusion, but also removing worries and concerns. I will also leave here, spending my remaining years in the mountains of Yi and Song."

Bamboo pole supports a fishing boat, Golden armor surrounds a warship. Searching for a monk's cottage on a snowy night, A spring morning with a banquet of courtesans. Long fasting incense, Close banquet gathers flowers. I feel idle is better than busy, Laughing at Zen in drunkenness. Whether or not the division is uncertain, Meeting together is remote fate. I am thinking of Yang's mansion, You should be looking at the Lu River. The west wind blows gently, The southward geese fly in formation. The dragon gate is outside the setting sun, The tide rises before the melon step. Autumn ends at the same time, The moon is round in both towns. Old friends gather joyfully, New poetry is full of spirit. Ashamed to have no \"White Snow\" tune, Difficult to respond to the \"Green Cloud\" article. Who appreciates the \"Golden Valley\" poetry, The \"Walled City\" essay is widely spread. Pearls should laugh at fish eyes, Lead does not subdue the Dragon Spring. Surprised by distant news of demons, Deep feelings are expressed through wine money. A hundred yards of silk in frost, Thirteen strings of jade columns. Chu liquor comes from the honored place, Qin sound accompanies the ear. When will we be under the red candle, Relaxed and happy, facing each other."

Protecting peace in the east, guarding the north gate firmly. The Jin state has wide borders, and the soldiers in Ping Qi are brave. The barbarians are frightened by the red banner, and the wild geese avoid the crow's call. The orders flow like water, and the benevolence moistens like salve. The roads are full of songs, and the army is drunk from a single cup. The generals and officers are fierce, and the guests and officials are elegant. There is no need for night watches, and no harm to the autumn hair. The gods assist, and the enemies flee. The evil stars disappear, and the rain extinguishes the stench. The watchtowers are high, and the rivers are far away. The spring clouds are clear, and the cold breeze blows. The tiger tail is intertwined with the tusk spear, and the dragon whiskers hold the dagger. The sky-reaching white rhinoceros belt, and the earth-illuminating purple lion robe. The Tibetan pipes play the willow, and the Yan princess pours grape wine. The silver hook is filled with wine, and the golden particles are in the lute. The joy of military service is forgotten, and the labor of serving the country is left behind. The purple star remains in the northern palace, and the green field is entrusted to the eastern meadow. Remembering past gatherings, I am ashamed of my humble position. I accompany the banquets and enjoy the beautiful scenery. We share the same flowers and moon, and we play the zither and poetry. The red strings touch the palace and major scales, and the grand pen vibrates with wind and chaos. The bamboo forest opens up, and the well pump is supported by the trees. The spring pond is curved, and there are three or two painted ships. The path is slippery with moss, and the pool is deep enough to cover the paddle. The green silk entangles the banks, and the red powder reflects the peach blossoms. Offer wine first, then lay down the wine. The dancing hair is gold and jade, and the singing neck is jade and centipede. Great virtue is difficult to surpass, and brilliant times are not easy to encounter. You may admire Zhang Fan, but the emperor does not abandon Yi Gao. My heart is attached, and my head is itching. The phoenix flies high, and the sparrows are free to live in the grass. I want to offer you a crazy letter, but I only bother to think about it. Unfortunately, 400 characters are light as a feather."

The wind frightens the geese as you walk, and the sun descends the hill with the years. Let your heart rest from sorrow, and let your twin brows grow slowly. You have the purple ribbon and the golden seal, and the green banner and the white pearl. The old age brings glory and compensation, and the way to eliminate worries and sorrows. Outside the mansion, there is plenty of wine; inside the hall, there are beautiful fabrics. You must fill your cup and drink, why don't you sing wildly? The brocade water flows through the Ba Xia Canyon, and Mount Xiangshan faces the Luohe River. The general rides a iron horse, and the minor official walks with a copper camel. Deep affection for pines and bamboos, high emotions for grapevines and ivy. The time is far away when you can hang up the cart, and you are not yet brave enough to visit your old friends."

You may accompany travelers on their spring journeys or follow monks as they practice meditation at night. Two years have passed, and you have forgotten your family affairs; the courtyard is overgrown with grass, and the kitchen smoke has lessened. Your cook tells you in the morning that the salt and rice are gone, and your maid tells you in the evening that her clothes are worn. Your family is unhappy, and your relatives are bored, but I sleep drunk and content. Rising, I will plan our livelihood; we will sell the ten acre garden in the south, then the five acre field in the east. After that, we will sell our home, expecting to earn two or three thousand strings of cash. Half will be used for your food and clothing expenses, and half will be used for my wine and meat money. Now I am seventy-one years old, my eyes are dim, my beard is white, and I have dizziness from the wind. I fear that this money will not be enough; I will return to the morning dew and night springs before death. It is not bad to stay here temporarily; eat when hungry, drink joyfully, and sleep peacefully. Life and death are as they should be; Alas, alas, Bai Letian, you are enlightened."

Fluttering and sinking are suited to their nature, enjoying themselves in their own way. Flowers contribute to the air of silver cups, pines add to the sound of jade zithers. Fish jump for joy, who can understand their pleasure? Ospreys rise, who can be surprised? Do not sing the ancient song, there is no dust to clean your tassels."

    "translate": "Selling the horse and releasing the willow branch, I cover my green and dark eyebrows with a touch of gold. The horse cannot speak, but it brays and looks back. The willow branch bows and kowtows to deliver its message. It says: \"For five years, your horse has carried you for a total of one thousand eight hundred days. It has not been startled or spirited under your command. I have served you for ten years, a total of three thousand six hundred days. In my service, I have neither erred nor lost. Although my appearance is now plain, I have not yet declined. The horse's strength is still robust, and there is no sign of illness. Even with the horse's strength, it can still carry you a step further. My song can accompany you with a drink. Once we both leave, there is no turning back. Therefore, as I am leaving, my words are filled with sorrow. As the horse is leaving, its cry is filled with sadness. This is human emotion, and this is the emotion of the horse. Can the lord be without emotion?\" I lower my head and sigh, then laugh. I say, \"Horse, don't whinny, Su, don't cry. Horse, return to your stable, Su, return to your room. My illness may be severe, but my age is not yet as bad as Jiang Ke's when he died. Why would I abandon my steed and part from Yu within a single day? Sing me a song of the willow branch, and I will drink from the golden cup. Together, we will return to the land of drunkenness.\""

Today, I drink with the beautiful one again, as the autumn wind gently caresses her hair. Time flows like water eastward, and the two sides of my temples cannot bear the hastening white sun. The eastern neighbor builds a high tower, its ornate carvings reflecting the sunlight. There are countless young women adorned in jewels and ornaments, and a banquet fit for three thousand guests. The neighboring scholar has just put down his curtain, reading ancient books at night and enduring hunger during the day. He is thirty years old and has not yet entered government service; can he expect to look up to the eastern neighbor? One day, he takes advantage of the wind, passes the exam, and is promoted to the top. Before the spring exam is over, he is promoted again in winter; who can follow him through the winds of nine thousand? Within ten years, he occupies a high position, and his horse and carriage are bustling before his door. Everyone is looking up to him; the creative energy creates rain and clouds. The eastern neighbor's tower remains unchanged, but the master is gone. There are no more golden and jade cars, and there is no one waiting at the red gate. The walls and towers lock away the spring in Chang'an, and the buildings gradually belong to the western neighbor. In the evening, the pines and bamboos shelter the birds, and the peaches and plums laugh heartlessly at people. Remember when the eastern neighbor's house was first built, it was not what it is now. The green birds perch on the tortoiseshell table, and the mandarin ducks fight on the lotus pond. Several autumns have passed, and the decline and prosperity have been going on for a long time. As long as the imperial capital's music and songs last, the five marquesses will get drunk every year by the pool."

But now, it seems as if nature itself is angry, allowing us to be devoured by fierce tigers day after day. Along the eastern roads, there are many barren hills and wastelands, making travel a dreaded experience. Especially in areas controlled by ruthless tyrants like Zhang Yanxiong, who treat their subjects with cruelty. In these regions, people hide in the woods and resist oppression. As time goes by, the lush grass turns to waste, and people no longer carry their weapons. The old tyrant is gone, but his legacy still haunts those who remain. Loyal and righteous people must adapt to this harsh reality, using cunning and stealth to survive. A capable and well-rounded person is essential for the betterment of the nation, not just a brave warrior. We must test Zhang Yanxiong's capabilities as a general and see which generals are willing to contribute to the betterment of the country."

The swift horses will not stay long, and the waves will not pause for a moment. We will follow the auspicious relationship, leaving our traces behind in this mountainous area."

    "translate": "A thousand miles of mountains and clouds embrace old journeys, the cold window and cool rain at night. Floating pavilions, flowers, and bamboo frequently trouble dreams, while the wind and smoke on the way are half sorrow. The grass beside people emptily drinks wine, and the flow of time and frequent illnesses make one tired of climbing the tower. I drink again at the cup, letting no love accumulate to white hair."

All ties are yet to be settled, sighing for the lack of children; despite a weak fate, we don't blame heaven. Drunken, we become dusty travelers; after a hundred cups, we seem like immortals in wine. In life, anywhere can be a source of joy; who cares about the autumn fragrance filling our temples?"

It's not hiding from my hometown, and I'm not foolish to live in the mountains and forests. Believe that the white jade is still in its raw form, who can cherish the pearl left in the vast ocean. In times of leisure, I enjoy the scenery and recite poetry, but I'm not happy when I drink wine and face the wind."
