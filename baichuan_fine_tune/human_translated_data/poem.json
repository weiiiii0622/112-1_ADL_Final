    "poem": "孤鴻海上來，池潢不敢顧。側見雙翠鳥，巢在三珠樹。矯矯珍木巔，得無金丸懼？美服患人指，高明逼神惡。今我游冥冥，弋者何所慕？",
    "translate": "A solitary swan flew in from the sea, Passing on ponds without thinking twice. Looking sideways it sees a couple of kingfishers of fine feathers, With their nest on a treasured tree of pearls enshrined.Atop a tree of such eminence they perched daintily, Are they not afraid of powerful metal slingshot strikes? Well dressers draw attention, High positions attract the Deity’s scrutiny for vice.As for I, much like that lone swan in the infinite sky, Wouldn’t bird-hunters find me difficult to pinpoint and acquire?."

With such sincerity I acknowledge the wild birds of passage, Entrusting them to my sentiments towards the distant send.Day and night I dream in vain, Yet is there anyone who can sympathise and comprehend? In power or in the wild, different worlds they are, So how could my loyalty and devotion ever be consoled?.英文翻譯 / English Translation (2011)﹕As a hermit I recline in isolation, Cleansing and clearing thoughts as reclusion intends.

But rather it is the cores of such mandarins that withstand the freeze.Such mandarins are befitting offerings to esteemed guests, Yet the distance keeps them from markets reach. One abides by circumstances for such is fate, Nature ravels not even to seekers who are keen.Yet the worldly only cared to peach and plum trees cultivate, Don’t these red mandarins trees provide also shade and foliage of green?.英文翻譯 / English Translation (2011)﹕South of the Yangtze, a kind of red mandarin grows.

    "translate": "I made my descent from the Zhongnan Mountains in the twilight, The mountain moon followed me down as it rose high. I looked back on the path taken, What a sight of viridian belts traversing the hillside.On my way I encountered a mountaineer and followed him home, Where children came to open a gate made of twigs intertwined. We passed through green bamboos onto a secluded path, As we walked on, our clothes brushed past winding vines.Pleasant conversations followed in the lodge where I could rest for the night, Accompanies by good wine, we were chatty all the while. We got on to sing folk songs like Wind in the Pines, By the time we had finished singing, many heavenly stars have retired.I was drunk in merriment and high in spirit was my company, In such ambience of joy, worldly concerns and politics were out of mind..英文翻譯 / English Translation (2011)﹕I made my descent from the Zhongnan Mountains that twilight had tainted blue, The mountain moon followed me down as it rose high.

    "translate": "We have been unable to see each other for so long, We have been like morning and evening stars that never meet in the sky. What a night this has been? For us to share this candlelight. For how long does youth last? Your hair has greyed and so has mine. Of the old acquaintances I called upon, half of them have ghosts become, Aghast and gut-wrenched I cried. All of a sudden twenty years have gone by Before I could again call on where you reside. You were not engaged when we went our separate ways, You are now married with children after all this time. They courteously greet their father’s friend, And my journey enquire. Before I could their curiosity satisfy, You have your son bringing out the wine. We nibble on spring chives just gathered in the evening rain, In a fresh meal that rough grains contain, You marvel at how unexpected such a reunion is, In one raise of a cup, you gulp down more than a pint. Pints after, high in spirit you are, yet sober still, And I am grateful for your friendship so genuine. From tomorrow, there will be mountains to us separate, What the future holds is veiled and vague."
